To create a comprehensive summary, we will analyze each description and resolve any contradictions.\n\nThe descriptions mention that the fiend is a being created by the narrator, Victor Frankenstein, and the creator. This suggests that the fiend is a creature created by someone, but the exact identity of the creator is unclear. However, since Victor Frankenstein is a well-known character from Mary Shelley's novel, it is likely that the fiend is the monster created by Victor Frankenstein.\n\nThe descriptions also mention that the fiend is a monster who committed murders.

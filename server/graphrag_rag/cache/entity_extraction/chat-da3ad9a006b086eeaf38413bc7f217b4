The\nplot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were\nthrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his\ndream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay\nin a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\nher whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged\nwith the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\nfor escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\nhe hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.\n\n“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the\ntrial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune\nand condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.\n\n“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\ndiscovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for\nwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\ndiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\nbecame a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\nhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,\nas he said, in some plan of future maintenance.\n\n“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could\nhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his\nvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\nof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The\narrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.\n\n“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\nlover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous\nnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\ntyrannical mandate.\n\n“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told\nher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\nhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\nFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\nConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential\nservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his\nproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.\n\n“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey\nwas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse\nto it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\nheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\nhe then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\ndetermination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a\nsum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\nbut who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\nGermany.\n\n“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her\nwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the\nArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country\nand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,\ninto good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for\nwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in\nwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at\nthe cottage of her lover.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\n\n“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.\nI learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire\ntheir virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\n\n“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\nbecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities\nwere called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the\nprogress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred\nin the beginning of the month of August of the same year.\n\n“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\ncollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on\nthe ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\nsome books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. \nFortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\nhad acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume\nof _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The\npossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\nstudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\nemployed in their ordinary occupations.\n\n“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

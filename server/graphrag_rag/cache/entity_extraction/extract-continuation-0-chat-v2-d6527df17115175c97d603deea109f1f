One of his most intimate friends was a\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\nwretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\nso little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.\n\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\nReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\nmerchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\n\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\nthere was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\nher in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\nsupport life.\n\nSeveral months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\nher an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\nby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\nchamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\n\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\naffection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\nstrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\na greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\nto his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\nand her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\nbenevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.\n\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\nfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\nmine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\nmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\nfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\nbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\ntheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\nand of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>BEAUFORT<|>PERSON<|>Beaufort was a merchant who fell into poverty and retreated to Lucerne with his daughter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LUCERNE<|>GEO<|>Beaufort and his daughter lived in Lucerne in wretchedness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEAUFORT'S DAUGHTER<|>PERSON<|>Beaufort's daughter attended her father with tenderness and procured plain work to earn a pittance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAROLINE BEAUFORT<|>PERSON<|>Caroline Beaufort was a woman of uncommon mould who supported her in adversity and became the wife of my father)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY FATHER<|>PERSON<|>My father loved Beaufort with true friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in unfortunate circumstances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REUSS<|>GEO<|>Beaufort's house was situated in a mean street near the Reuss)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>GEO<|>My father conducted Caroline Beaufort to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MY MOTHER<|>PERSON<|>My mother was a woman of virtue and was recompensed by my father for the sorrows she had endured)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITALY<|>GEO<|>My father and my mother sought the pleasant climate of Italy as a restorative for her weakened frame)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>My father and my mother visited Germany)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>My father and my mother visited France)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAPOLES<|>GEO<|>I was born at Naples)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEAUFORT<|>LUCERNE<|>Beaufort and his daughter lived in Lucerne in wretchedness<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEAUFORT<|>BEAUFORT'S DAUGHTER<|>Beaufort's daughter attended her father with tenderness and procured plain work to earn a pittance<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEAUFORT<|>CAROLINE BEAUFORT<|>Caroline Beaufort was a woman of uncommon mould who supported her in adversity and became the wife of my father<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FATHER<|>BEAUFORT<|>My father loved Beaufort with true friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in unfortunate circumstances<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FATHER<|>BEAUFORT'S DAUGHTER<|>My father conducted Caroline Beaufort to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FATHER<|>CAROLINE BEAUFORT<|>My father married Caroline Beaufort<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAROLINE BEAUFORT<|>BEAUFORT<|>Caroline Beaufort was a woman of uncommon mould who supported her in adversity and became the wife of my father<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAROLINE BEAUFORT<|>BEAUFORT'S DAUGHTER<|>Caroline Beaufort was a woman of uncommon mould who supported her in adversity and became the wife of my father<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY MOTHER<|>MY FATHER<|>My mother was a woman of virtue and was recompensed by my father for the sorrows she had endured<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY MOTHER<|>CAROLINE BEAUFORT<|>My mother was a woman of virtue and was recompensed by my father for the sorrows she had endured<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FATHER<|>GENEVA<|>My father conducted Caroline Beaufort to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FATHER<|>ITALY<|>My father and my mother sought the pleasant climate of Italy as a restorative for her weakened frame<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FATHER<|>GERMANY<|>My father and my mother visited Germany<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FATHER<|>FRANCE<|>My father and my mother visited France<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY FATHER<|>NAPOLES<|>I was born at Naples<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY MOTHER<|>ITALY<|>My father and my mother sought the pleasant climate of Italy as a restorative for her weakened frame<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY MOTHER<|>GERMANY<|>My father and my mother visited Germany<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY MOTHER<|>FRANCE<|>My father and my mother visited France<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MY MOTHER<|>NAPOLES<|>I was born at Naples<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

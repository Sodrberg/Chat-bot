Still thou canst listen to me and grant\nme thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\nfrom you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\nthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\nthe mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends\nto hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another\nworld, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,\nwhether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of\nyour own speedy ruin.”\n\nAs he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart\nwas full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the\nvarious arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to\nhis tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\nresolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.\nFor the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\nhis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\ncomplained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with\nhis demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite\nrock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy\nheart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating\nmyself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began\nhis tale.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\n\n“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of\nmy being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.\nA strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\nand smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\nlearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By\ndegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\nwas obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled\nme, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now\nsuppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,\ndescended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my\ntouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with\nno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light\nbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I\nwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the\nforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting\nfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This\nroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I\nfound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst\nat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.\n\n“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it\nwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted\nyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\nclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\nnight. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\ndistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\ndown and wept.\n\n“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\npleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\ntrees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,\nbut it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.\nI was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with\nwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct\nideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,\nand thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on\nall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\npleasure.\n\n“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\ngreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\nother. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\ndrink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted\nwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\nears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\noften intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,\nwith greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the\nboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I\ntried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.\nSometimes I wished to express my\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

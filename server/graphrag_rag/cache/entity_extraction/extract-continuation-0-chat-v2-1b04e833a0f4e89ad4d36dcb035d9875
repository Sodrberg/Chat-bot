But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\nmy heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\nJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\nmy soul with anguish.\n\nBut in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\ninstruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long\nhad in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had\nin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\ntaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\nEuropean colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the\nexecution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\nenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this\nas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\nnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\nany care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,\nalleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also\nbegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\nwas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\non the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\nanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips\nto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.\n\nAfter passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\nScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the\nbeauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient\nallurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,\nwhere he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,\nalthough I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and\nall the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.\n\nWe had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\nFebruary. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\nnorth at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\nMatlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\nthis tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\nthe materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\nobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\n\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at\nWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us\nmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\nstately deer were all novelties to us.\n\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\nthere more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles\nI. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,\nafter the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\nParliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\nmight be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\nthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\nThe colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\ndomes, embosomed among aged trees.\n\nI enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\nmemory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed\nfor peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never\nvisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\nis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\nthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\nelasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\nentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\nI shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\npitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\n\nWe passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\nanimating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery\nwere often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\nthemselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\nfield on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated\nfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\nof liberty and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>HENRY<|>PERSON<|>Henry soothed the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILLIAM<|>PERSON<|>William's blood sealed the barrier between the narrator and his fellow men)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUSTINE<|>PERSON<|>Justine's blood sealed the barrier between the narrator and his fellow men)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLERVAL<|>PERSON<|>Clerval was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>Clerval's design was to visit India)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRIAIN<|>GEO<|>Clerval's plan to further the execution of his plan to visit India was to be carried out in Britain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN COLONIZATION AND TRADE<|>EVENT<|>Clerval's plan to visit India was to assist the progress of European colonization and trade)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDSOR<|>GEO<|>The narrator and Clerval visited Windsor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OXFORD<|>GEO<|>The narrator and Clerval visited Oxford)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATLOCK<|>GEO<|>The narrator and Clerval planned to visit Matlock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CUMBERLAND LAKES<|>GEO<|>The narrator and Clerval planned to visit the Cumberland lakes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERTH<|>GEO<|>A person in Scotland invited the narrator and Clerval to visit Perth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>GEO<|>The narrator and Clerval had a visitor from Geneva)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDINBURGH<|>GEO<|>The narrator and Clerval did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES I<|>PERSON<|>Charles I collected his forces in Oxford)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FALKLAND<|>PERSON<|>The amiable Falkland was a companion of Charles I)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GORING<|>PERSON<|>The insolent Goring was a companion of Charles I)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES I'S QUEEN<|>PERSON<|>Charles I's queen was a companion of Charles I)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES I'S SON<|>PERSON<|>Charles I's son was a companion of Charles I)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE ISIS<|>GEO<|>The lovely Isis flowed beside Oxford)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND<|>GEO<|>The narrator planned to finish his labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS<|>EVENT<|>The narrator packed up his chemical instruments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MATERIALS<|>EVENT<|>The narrator packed up the materials he had collected)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENRY<|>WILLIAM<|>Henry soothed the narrator, but William's blood sealed the barrier between the narrator and his fellow men<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENRY<|>JUSTINE<|>Henry soothed the narrator, but Justine's blood sealed the barrier between the narrator and his fellow men<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLERVAL<|>INDIA<|>Clerval's design was to visit India<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLERVAL<|>BRIAIN<|>Clerval's plan to further the execution of his plan to visit India was to be carried out in Britain<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLERVAL<|>EUROPEAN COLONIZATION AND TRADE<|>Clerval's plan to visit India was to assist the progress of European colonization and trade<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDSOR<|>OXFORD<|>The narrator and Clerval visited Windsor and Oxford<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MATLOCK<|>THE CUMBERLAND LAKES<|>The narrator and Clerval planned to visit Matlock and the Cumberland lakes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERTH<|>GENEVA<|>A person in Scotland invited the narrator and Clerval to visit Perth, where they had a visitor from Geneva<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDINBURGH<|>OXFORD<|>The narrator and Clerval did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but visited Oxford<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES I<|>FALKLAND<|>Charles I collected his forces in Oxford, and the amiable Falkland was a companion of Charles I<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES I<|>GORING<|>Charles I collected his forces in Oxford, and the insolent Goring was a companion of Charles I<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES I<|>CHARLES I'S QUEEN<|>Charles I collected his forces in Oxford, and Charles I's queen was a companion of Charles I<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES I<|>CHARLES I'S SON<|>Charles I collected his forces in Oxford, and Charles I's son was a companion of Charles I<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE ISIS<|>OXFORD<|>The lovely Isis flowed beside Oxford<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND<|>THE CHEMICAL INSTRUMENTS<|>The narrator planned to finish his labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland, and packed up his chemical instruments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND<|>THE MATERIALS<|>The narrator planned to finish his labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland, and packed up the materials he had collected<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

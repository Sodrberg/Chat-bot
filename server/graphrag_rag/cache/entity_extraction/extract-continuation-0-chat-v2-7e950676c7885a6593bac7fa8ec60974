I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\nof my undertaking.\n\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\nperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\n\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\n\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>PROJECT GUTENBERG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Project Gutenberg is a digital library that provides free access to over 60,000 e-books)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>PERSON<|>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley is the author of the novel Frankenstein)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>EVENT<|>Frankenstein is a novel written by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST PETERSBURGH<|>GEO<|>St. Petersburgh is a city in Russia where the story begins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LONDON<|>GEO<|>London is a city in England where the narrator is from)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETERSBURGH<|>GEO<|>Petersburgh is a city in Russia where the narrator is currently located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN<|>GEO<|>The North Pacific Ocean is a region that the narrator is trying to reach)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH POLE<|>GEO<|>The North Pole is a region that the narrator is trying to reach)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARGARET<|>PERSON<|>Margaret is the narrator's sister)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNCLE THOMAS<|>PERSON<|>Uncle Thomas is the narrator's uncle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOMAS<|>PERSON<|>Thomas is the narrator's father)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUDITH BOSS<|>PERSON<|>Judith Boss is a person involved in the production of the e-book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTY PHILLIPS<|>PERSON<|>Christy Phillips is a person involved in the production of the e-book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYNN HANNINEN<|>PERSON<|>Lynn Hanninen is a person involved in the production of the e-book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVID MELTZER<|>PERSON<|>David Meltzer is a person involved in the production of the e-book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AL HAINES<|>PERSON<|>Al Haines is a person involved in the production of the e-book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MENNO DE LEEUW<|>PERSON<|>Menno de Leeuw is a person involved in the production of the e-book)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley wrote the novel Frankenstein<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>PROJECT GUTENBERG<|>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's novel Frankenstein is available on Project Gutenberg<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROJECT GUTENBERG<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Project Gutenberg provides free access to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's novel Frankenstein<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ST PETERSBURGH<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>The story of Frankenstein begins in St. Petersburgh where Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley is currently located<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LONDON<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley is from London<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETERSBURGH<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley is currently located in Petersburgh<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley is trying to reach the North Pacific Ocean<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH POLE<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley is trying to reach the North Pole<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGARET<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>Margaret is the narrator's sister and the recipient of the letter<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNCLE THOMAS<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>Uncle Thomas is the narrator's uncle and has a library of books on voyages<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOMAS<|>MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT SHELLEY<|>Thomas is the narrator's father and has forbidden his uncle to allow him to embark in a seafaring life<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUDITH BOSS<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Judith Boss is involved in the production of the e-book of Frankenstein<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHRISTY PHILLIPS<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Christy Phillips is involved in the production of the e-book of Frankenstein<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LYNN HANNINEN<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Lynn Hanninen is involved in the production of the e-book of Frankenstein<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DAVID MELTZER<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>David Meltzer is involved in the production of the e-book of Frankenstein<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AL HAINES<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Al Haines is involved in the production of the e-book of Frankenstein<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MENNO DE LEEUW<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Menno de Leeuw is involved in the production of the e-book of Frankenstein<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

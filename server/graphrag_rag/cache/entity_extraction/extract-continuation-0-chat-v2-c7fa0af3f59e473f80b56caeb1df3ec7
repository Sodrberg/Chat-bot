If you will\nkeep everything tidy and homelike, you can stay with us, and\nyou shall want for nothing in the world.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, with all my heart!\" cried Snow White. So there she\nstayed, and washed and sewed and knitted, and kept house for the\nkindly little men. Every day the seven dwarfs went off to one of\nthe seven hills to dig for gems and gold. Each evening after\nsunset they returned, and then their supper had to be all ready\nand laid out on the table. But every morning before they left\nthey would warn Snow White about the Queen.\n\n\"We don't trust her,\" they said. \"One of these days she'll find\nout that you are here. So be careful, child, and don't let anyone\ninto the house.\"\n\n*          *          *          *          *\n\nThe dwarfs were right. One day the Queen, just to make sure,\nstood in front of her mirror and said:\n\n   \"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n   Who's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nand the mirror replied:\n\n   \"Thou art very fair, Oh Queen,\n   But the fairest ever seen\n   Dwells within the wooded glen\n   With the seven little men.\"\n\nThe Queen turned green with fury when she heard this, for now she\nknew that the huntsman had deceived her, and that Snow White was\nstill alive.\n\nDay and night she sat and pondered, and wondered what to do, for\nas long as she was not the fairest in the land, her jealous heart\ngave her no rest. At last she thought out a plan: she dyed her\nface and dressed herself to look like a peddler woman. She did it\nso well that no one would have known her, and then, with a\nbasketful of strings and laces, she made her way over the seven\nhills to the home of the seven dwarfs. When she reached it she\nknocked at the little door and cried, \"Fine wares for sale! Fine\nwares for sale!\"\n\nSnow White peeped out of the window and said, \"Good day, my dear\nwoman, what have you there in your basket?\"\n\n\"Good wares! Fine wares!\" said the woman. \"Strings, cords and\nlaces, of all kinds and colors,\" and she held up a loop of gaily\ncolored bodice laces.\n\nSnow White was entranced with the gaudy trifle and she thought to\nherself, \"The dwarfs were only afraid of the wicked Queen, but\nsurely there can be no harm in letting this honest woman into the\nhouse.\" So she opened the door and bought the showy laces.\n\n\"Child,\" said the woman as she entered the little room, \"what a\nsight you are with that loose bodice! Come, let me fix you up\nwith your new laces, so you'll look neat and trim for once.\"\n\nSnow White, who suspected nothing, stood up to have the new gay\nlaces put into her bodice, but the woman worked quickly and laced\nher up so tightly that Snow White lost her breath and sank to the\nfloor.\n\n\"Now!\" cried the Queen as she cast a last look at the motionless\nchild, \"now you have _been_ the fairest in the land!\"\n\nLuckily this happened just as the sun was sinking behind the\nseventh hill, so it was not long before the dwarfs came trudging\nhome from work. When they saw their dear little Snow White lying\nthere, not moving, not talking, they were deeply alarmed. They\nlifted her up, and when they saw how tightly she was laced, they\nhurriedly cut the cords in two. And in that moment Snow White\ncaught her breath again, opened her eyes, and all was well once\nmore.\n\nWhen the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, \"That was no\npeddler woman, Snow White; that was the wicked Queen. So please\nbeware, dear child, and let no one into the house while we're\ngone.\"\n\n*          *          *          *          *\n\nBy this time the Queen had reached her home, so she rushed to her\nmirror and said:\n\n   \"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n   Who's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nand to her dismay it answered as before:\n\n\"Thou art very fair, Oh Queen,\nBut the fairest ever seen\nDwells within the wooded glen\nWith the seven little men.\"\n\nAt this the Queen's fury knew no bounds and she said, \"But now,\nmy pretty one--now I'll think up something which _will_ be\nthe end of you!\" And soon she was very busy.\n\nYou will not be surprised, I am sure, when I tell you that this\nwicked creature was skilled in the arts of witchcraft; and with\nthe help of these arts she now worked out her second scheme. She\nfashioned a comb--a beautiful golden comb, but a poisonous one.\nThen, disguising herself as a different old woman, she crossed\nthe seven hills to the home of the seven dwarfs. When she reached\nit she knocked at the door and cried as before, \"Good wares for\nsale! Fine wares! For sale! For sale!\"\n\nSnow White peeped out of the window but this time she said, \"You\nmay as well go on your way, good\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##

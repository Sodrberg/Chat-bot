My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\nmy proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me,\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\nhoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive\nof the enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\nuniversity. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\nhappened that protracted my stay.\n\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\nlife. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\ninquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death. I became\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\nthe apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\nfood for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\ncharnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how the\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\nsecret.\n\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\ntrue. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\ndiscovery were distinct and probable. After days and nights of\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\nanimation upon lifeless matter.\n\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture. After so much time spent in\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\nof the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it\nall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\naccomplished. I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\nineffectual light.\n\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

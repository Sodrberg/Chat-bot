Despondency\nrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\nnever, never again to rise.”\n\nMust I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert\nseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his\nvalue and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.\n\n“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so\nmiserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh\naffections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any\nman be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even\nwhere the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,\nthe companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our\nminds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our\ninfantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,\nare never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\ncertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a\nbrother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,\nsuspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,\nhowever strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be\ncontemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only\nthrough habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever\nI am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of\nClerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one\nfeeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I\nwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\nutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But\nsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I\ngave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”\n\nMy beloved Sister,\n\nSeptember 2d.\n\n\nI write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever\ndoomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit\nit. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and\nthreaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I\nhave persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have\nnone to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our\nsituation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is\nterrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered\nthrough me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.\n\nAnd what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my\ndestruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and\nyou will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My\nbeloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,\nin prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband\nand lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!\n\nMy unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He\nendeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession\nwhich he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have\nhappened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite\nof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel\nthe power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\nrouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these\nvast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the\nresolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\ncaused by this despair.\n\nSeptember 5th.\n\n\nA scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is\nhighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot\nforbear recording it.\n\nWe are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger\nof being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of\nmy unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\ndesolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire\nstill glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly\nroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\nlifelessness.\n\nI mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.\nThis morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his\neyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half\na dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They\nentered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his\ncompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation\nto me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.\nWe were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they\nfeared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free\npassage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\nlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted\nthis. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\npromise that if\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

Victor, he is murdered!\n\n“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\ncircumstances of the transaction.\n\n“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\nwalk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\nour walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\non before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until\nthey should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\n\n“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\nreturned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with\ntorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\nlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\nElizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I\ndiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and\nactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the\nprint of the murder’s finger was on his neck.\n\n“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to\nsee the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my\ndarling child!’\n\n“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same\nevening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\nminiature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and\nwas doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We\nhave no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him\nare unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\n\n“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;\nher words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?\nYour dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live\nto witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!\n\n“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\nfestering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\nwith hatred for your enemies.\n\n“Your affectionate and afflicted father,\n\n“Alphonse Frankenstein.\n\n\n\n“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”\n\n\n\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\nsurprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first\nexpressed on receiving new from my friends. I threw the letter on the\ntable, and covered my face with my hands.\n\n“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me\nweep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,\nwhat has happened?”\n\nI motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\nroom in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of\nClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.\n\n“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;\n“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”\n\n“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”\n\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\nhe could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,\n“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had\nseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\nuntimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How\nmuch more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little\nfellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but\nhe is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.\nA sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer\nbe a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\nsurvivors.”\n\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\nimpressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in\nsolitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\ncabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.\n\nMy journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed\nto console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends;\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

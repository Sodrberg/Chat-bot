I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\ndisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\nnearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\nhome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\nour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\ncauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\nearliest sensations I can remember.\n\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\nof the infidels.\n\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\nwhich we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\nthe development of filial love.\n\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\nindiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\npossessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\n\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And\nClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\nambition.\n\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\n\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

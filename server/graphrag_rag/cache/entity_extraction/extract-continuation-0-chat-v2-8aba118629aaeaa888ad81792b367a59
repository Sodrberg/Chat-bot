I knew that I must travel in a\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\nonly guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\ndid not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,\nheartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\nand then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\nBut on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\ndetermined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\nany other being that wore the human form.\n\nâ€œMy travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was\nlate in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\nI travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\nhuman being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\nrain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\nof the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,\nearth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The\nmildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\nand bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\ndeeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow\nfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents\nnow and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\noften wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me\nno respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\nnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\non the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\nand the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\nmanner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\n\nâ€œI generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\nsecured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\nthe air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\nappeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of\nthese sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\nforgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears\nagain bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\nthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\n\nâ€œI continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\nHere I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\nthe sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\nof a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\ntowards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\nsomeone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides\nof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\nrapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\nfrom the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She\nwas senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On\nseeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\nhastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I\nhardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\nwhich he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my\ninjurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\n\nâ€œThis was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\nfrom destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\npain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of\nkindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\nbefore gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by\npain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the\nagony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\n\nâ€œFor some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\ncure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\nrate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented\nalso by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\ninfliction. My daily vows rose for revengeâ€”a deep and deadly revenge,\nsuch as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\nendured\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>GEO<|>Geneva is the native town of the creator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EARTH<|>GEO<|>The earth is the place where the narrator is traveling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWITZERLAND<|>GEO<|>Switzerland is the country where the narrator arrives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATOR<|>PERSON<|>The creator is the one who made the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NARRATOR<|>PERSON<|>The narrator is the one who is traveling and experiencing emotions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YOUNG GIRL<|>PERSON<|>The young girl is the one who falls into the river and is saved by the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSTIC<|>PERSON<|>The rustic is the one who shoots the narrator and escapes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOOD<|>GEO<|>The wood is the place where the narrator and the young girl meet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIVER<|>GEO<|>The river is the place where the young girl falls in)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>CREATOR<|>The creator is from Geneva<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREATOR<|>NARRATOR<|>The creator made the narrator<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>EARTH<|>The narrator is traveling on the earth<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>SWITZERLAND<|>The narrator arrives in Switzerland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YOUNG GIRL<|>NARRATOR<|>The narrator saves the young girl from the river<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSTIC<|>YOUNG GIRL<|>The rustic shoots the narrator after saving the young girl<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSTIC<|>NARRATOR<|>The rustic shoots the narrator<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOOD<|>NARRATOR<|>The narrator meets the young girl in the wood<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOOD<|>YOUNG GIRL<|>The young girl falls in the river near the wood<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RIVER<|>YOUNG GIRL<|>The young girl falls into the river<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RIVER<|>NARRATOR<|>The narrator saves the young girl from the river<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

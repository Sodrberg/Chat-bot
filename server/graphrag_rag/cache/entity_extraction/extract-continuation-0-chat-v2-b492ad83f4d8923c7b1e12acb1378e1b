They laid her upon a bier, and all\nseven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days\nlong.\n\nThen they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she\nwere living, and still had her pretty red cheeks.  They said,\nwe could not bury her in the dark ground, and they had a\ntransparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from\nall sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it\nin golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter.  Then they\nput the coffin out upon the mountain, and one of them always\nstayed by it and watched it.  And birds came too, and wept for\nsnow-white, first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.\n\nAnd now snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she\ndid not change, but looked as if she were asleep, for she was as\nwhite as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as\nebony.\n\nIt happened, however, that a king's son came into the forest, and\nwent to the dwarfs, house to spend the night.  He saw the coffin\non the mountain, and the beautiful snow-white within it, and read\nwhat was written upon it in golden letters.  Then he said to the\ndwarfs, let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want\nfor it.  But the dwarfs answered, we will not part with it for all\nthe gold in the world.  Then he said, let me have it as a gift, for\nI cannot live without seeing snow-white.  I will honor and prize\nher as my dearest possession.  As he spoke in this way the good\ndwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.\n\nAnd now the king's son had it carried away by his servants on\ntheir shoulders.  And it happened that they stumbled over a\ntree-stump, and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple\nwhich snow-white had bitten off came out of her throat.  And\nbefore long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin,\nsat up, and was\nonce more alive.  Oh, heavens, where am I, she cried.  The king's\nson, full of joy, said, you are with me.  And told her what had\nhappened, and said, I love you more than everything in the\nworld, come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife.\n\nAnd snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding\nwas held with great show and splendor.  But snow-white's\nwicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast.  When she had\narrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the\nlooking-glass, and said,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nThe glass answered,\n          oh, queen, of all here the fairest art thou,\n          but the young queen is fairer by far as I trow.\n\nThen the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched,\nso utterly wretched that she knew not what to do.  At first she\nwould not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and\nhad to go to see the young queen.  And when she went in she\nrecognized snow-white, and she stood still with rage and fear,\nand could not stir.  But iron slippers had already been put upon\nthe fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before\nher.  Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance\nuntil she dropped down dead.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>PERSON<|>Snow-white is a king's daughter who was poisoned by a piece of apple and was placed in a transparent coffin on a mountain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DWARFS<|>PERSON<|>The dwarfs are a group of seven people who found snow-white and placed her in the transparent coffin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING'S SON<|>PERSON<|>The king's son is a young man who fell in love with snow-white and took her away from the dwarfs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUEEN<|>PERSON<|>The queen is snow-white's wicked step-mother who is jealous of snow-white's beauty)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNOW-WHITE'S WEDDING<|>EVENT<|>Snow-white's wedding was held with great show and splendor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIVE<|>EVENT<|>Snow-white was brought back to life when the poisonous piece of apple was removed from her throat)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POISONOUS PIECE OF APPLE<|>EVENT<|>The poisonous piece of apple was the cause of snow-white's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLASS<|>GEO<|>The glass was a magical object that told the queen that snow-white was the fairest of them all)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOUNTAIN<|>GEO<|>The mountain was where the dwarfs placed snow-white's transparent coffin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FOREST<|>GEO<|>The forest was where the king's son met the dwarfs and saw snow-white's coffin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREE-STUMP<|>GEO<|>The tree-stump was where the king's son's servants stumbled and the poisonous piece of apple was removed from snow-white's throat)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>DWARFS<|>Snow-white was found by the dwarfs and they placed her in a transparent coffin on a mountain<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>KING'S SON<|>The king's son fell in love with snow-white and took her away from the dwarfs<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>QUEEN<|>The queen was jealous of snow-white's beauty and tried to kill her<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING'S SON<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>The king's son fell in love with snow-white and took her away from the dwarfs<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>The queen was jealous of snow-white's beauty and tried to kill her<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DWARFS<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>The dwarfs found snow-white and placed her in a transparent coffin on a mountain<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING'S SON<|>DWARFS<|>The king's son met the dwarfs and saw snow-white's coffin<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN<|>GLASS<|>The queen asked the glass who was the fairest of them all and it told her that snow-white was<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLASS<|>QUEEN<|>The glass told the queen that snow-white was the fairest of them all<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN<|>SNOW-WHITE'S WEDDING<|>The queen was invited to snow-white's wedding but was forced to dance in red-hot shoes until she died<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNOW-WHITE'S WEDDING<|>QUEEN<|>The queen was invited to snow-white's wedding but was forced to dance in red-hot shoes until she died<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>ALIVE<|>Snow-white was brought back to life when the poisonous piece of apple was removed from her throat<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIVE<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>Snow-white was brought back to life when the poisonous piece of apple was removed from her throat<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POISONOUS PIECE OF APPLE<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>The poisonous piece of apple was the cause of snow-white's death<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>POISONOUS PIECE OF APPLE<|>The poisonous piece of apple was the cause of snow-white's death<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOUNTAIN<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>Snow-white's transparent coffin was placed on a mountain<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNOW-WHITE<|>MOUNTAIN<|>Snow-white's transparent coffin was placed on a mountain<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FOREST<|>KING'S SON<|>The king's son met the dwarfs in the forest and saw snow-white's coffin<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING'S SON<|>FOREST<|>The king's son met the dwarfs in the forest and saw snow-white's coffin<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TREE-STUMP<|>KING'S SON<|>The king's son's servants stumbled over a tree-stump and the poisonous piece of apple was removed from snow-white's throat<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KING'S SON<|>TREE-STUMP<|>The king's son's servants stumbled over a tree-stump and the poisonous piece of apple was removed from snow-white's throat<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.”\n\n“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but\nsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\nsufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\nbed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.\n\nIt was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was\nentirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\ndifficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing\ndraught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he\ntold me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.\n\nHis sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat\nby his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\npresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\nsaid, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\nsoon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think\nnot, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\nhatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\njustified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I\nhave been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\nIn a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\nbound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\nwell-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\nthat. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\nmy attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\nmisery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\ncreate a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\nand selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\nbeings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\nknow where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was\nmine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\nasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\nwhen I am only induced by reason and virtue.\n\n“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\nthis task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\nlittle chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these\npoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\nleave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\napproach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\nmay still be misled by passion.\n\n“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\nother respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\nonly happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of\nthe beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,\nWalton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\nbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\nscience and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been\nblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”\n\nHis voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his\neffort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he\nattempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\nhis eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\naway from his lips.\n\nMargaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\nglorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the\ndepth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and\nfeeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\ndisappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find\nconsolation.\n\nI am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the\nbreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there\nis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\nwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.\nGood night, my sister.\n\nGreat God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\nremembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail\nit; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this\nfinal and wonderful catastrophe.\n\nI entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\nfriend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\ndescribe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its\nproportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\nlocks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\napparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my\napproach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

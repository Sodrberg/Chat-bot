The others came up and each called out, somebody has been\nlying in my bed too.  But the seventh when he looked at his bed\nsaw little snow-white, who was lying asleep therein.  And he\ncalled the others, who came running up, and they cried out with\nastonishment, and brought their seven little candles and let the\nlight fall on little snow-white.  Oh, heavens, oh, heavens, cried\nthey, what a lovely child.  And they were so glad that they did\nnot wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed.  And the\nseventh dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and\nso passed the night.\n\nWhen it was morning little snow-white awoke, and was frightened\nwhen she saw the seven dwarfs.  But they were friendly and asked\nher what her name was.  My name is snow-white, she answered.\nHow have you come to our house, said the dwarfs.  Then she told\nthem that her step-mother had wished to have her killed, but\nthat the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run for\nthe whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling.\n\nThe dwarfs said, if you will take care of our house, cook, make\nthe beds, wash, sew and knit, and if you will keep everything neat\nand clean you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing.\nYes, said snow-white, with all my heart.  And she stayed with\nthem.  She kept the house in order for them.  In the mornings\nthey went to the mountains and looked for copper and gold, in the\nevenings they came back, and then their supper had to be ready.\nThe girl was alone the whole day, so the good dwarfs warned her\nand said, beware of your step-mother, she will soon know that you\nare here, be sure to let no one come in.\n\nBut the queen, believing that she had eaten snow-white's lung and\nliver, could not but think that she was again the first and most\nbeautiful of all, and she went to her looking-glass and said,\nlooking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nAnd the glass answered,\n          oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,\n          but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,\n          snow-white is still alive and well,\n          and none is so fair as she.\n\nThen she was astounded, for she knew that the looking-glass\nnever spoke falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed\nher, and that little snow-white was still alive.\n\nAnd so she thought and thought again how she might kill her,\nfor so long as she was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let\nher have no rest.  And when she had at last thought of something\nto do, she painted her face, and dressed herself like an old\npedlar-woman, and no one could have known her.  In this disguise\nshe went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, and\nknocked at the door and cried, pretty things to sell, very cheap,\nvery cheap.  Little snow-white looked out of the window and called\nout, good-day my good woman, what have you to sell.  Good things,\npretty things, she answered, stay-laces of all colors, and she\npulled out one which was woven of bright-colored silk.  I may let\nthe worthy old woman in, thought snow-white, and she unbolted the\ndoor and bought the pretty laces.  Child, said the old woman,\nwhat a fright you look, come, I will lace you properly for once.\nSnow-white had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let herself\nbe laced with the new laces.  But the old woman laced so quickly\nand so tightly that snow-white lost her breath and fell down as\nif dead.  Now I am the most beautiful, said the queen to herself,\nand ran away.\n\nNot long afterwards, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home,\nbut how shocked they were when they saw their dear little snow-white\nlying on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor\nmoved, and seemed to be dead.  They lifted her up, and, as they\nsaw that she was laced too tightly, they cut the laces, then she\nbegan to breathe a little, and after a while came to life again.\nWhen the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, the old\npedlar-woman was no one\nelse than the wicked queen, take care and let no one come in\nwhen we are not with you.\n\nBut the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front\nof the glass and asked,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nAnd it answered as before,\n          oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

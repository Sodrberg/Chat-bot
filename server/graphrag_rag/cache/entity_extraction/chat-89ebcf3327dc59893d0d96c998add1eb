I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\nthe body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\nalso, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\nvictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\nbenefactor—”\n\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\nI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\n\nA fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\nravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\nattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\ntormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\nmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\nmy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\nbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\n\nWhy did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\nsink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\nchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\nnext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\nmade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\nthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?\n\nBut I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\na dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\nIt was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\nand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\nwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\n\nThis sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\nme. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\nthat class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\npersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\nand the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\n\n“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\n\nI replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\nbut if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\nstill alive to feel this misery and horror.”\n\n“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none\nof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\nwith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\n\nI turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\nlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\nof reality.\n\nAs the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\nthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\nsecond. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\nhangman who would gain his fee?\n\nThese were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\nshown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison\nto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\nhad provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to\nsee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\nevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\nmiserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see\nthat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\nintervals.\n\nOne day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\nhalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\nremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\nconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\npenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\nthoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

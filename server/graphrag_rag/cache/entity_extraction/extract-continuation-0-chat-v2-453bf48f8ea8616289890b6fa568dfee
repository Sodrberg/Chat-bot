Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\ngradually recovered my health.\n\nAs my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\nmelancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\nfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation\ninto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\nrelapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\nlife? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\ndrawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\nthrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\nme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\nsink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\nwish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\nmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\nmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\n\nThe season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months\nin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\ntown where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\ncare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared\nthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\nbrought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.\n\nMy father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\natmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\nparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\npalace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes\nthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\norbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\nthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\nfirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\n\nMy father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked\nof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\nthese words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\nwish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\ncousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\nchildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\nthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\ndespair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\nexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\n\nYet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\ntriumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\nreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\nI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\nchance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\nblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\nthe existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\nmockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to\ndelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\njourney, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My\nstrength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\npreyed upon my wasted frame.\n\nStill, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\nmy father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\nbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\nIt was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\nthe dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\nsight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\nsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\nyet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\nshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\nthat I was deceived by no vision and that Cl\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>HENRY<|>PERSON<|>Henry is the deceased friend of the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KIRWIN<|>PERSON<|>Mr. Kirwin is a friend of the narrator who helped with his defense)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INGOLSTADT<|>GEO<|>Ingolstadt is a place where the narrator first saw the monster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>GEO<|>Geneva is the narrator's native country)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>PERSON<|>Elizabeth is the narrator's cousin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERNEST<|>PERSON<|>Ernest is the narrator's cousin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHONE<|>GEO<|>The Rhone is a river in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORKNEY ISLANDS<|>GEO<|>The Orkney Islands are a place where the narrator was at the time of his friend's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAVRE-DE-GRACE<|>GEO<|>Havre-de-Grace is a port city in France)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLERVALL<|>PERSON<|>Clerval is the deceased friend of the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONSTER<|>PERSON<|>The monster is a creature created by the narrator)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HENRY<|>CLERVALL<|>Henry and Clerval were friends<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIRWIN<|>HENRY<|>Mr. Kirwin helped with Henry's defense<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KIRWIN<|>CLERVALL<|>Mr. Kirwin helped with Clerval's defense<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INGOLSTADT<|>MONSTER<|>The narrator first saw the monster in Ingolstadt<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>ELIZABETH<|>Elizabeth lives in Geneva<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>ERNEST<|>Ernest lives in Geneva<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RHONE<|>GENEVA<|>The Rhone is a river near Geneva<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ORKNEY ISLANDS<|>HENRY<|>The narrator was on the Orkney Islands at the time of Henry's death<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAVRE-DE-GRACE<|>GENEVA<|>The narrator sailed from Havre-de-Grace to Geneva<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLERVALL<|>MONSTER<|>Clerval was killed by the monster<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>HENRY<|>The monster killed Henry<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

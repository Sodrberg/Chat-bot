When she reached\nit she knocked at the door and cried as before, \"Good wares for\nsale! Fine wares! For sale! For sale!\"\n\nSnow White peeped out of the window but this time she said, \"You\nmay as well go on your way, good woman. I am not allowed to let\nanyone in.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" said the old woman. \"You needn't let me in, but\nsurely there can be no harm in _looking_ at my wares,\" and\nshe held up the glittering poisonous comb.\n\nSnow White was so charmed by it that she forgot all about the\ndwarfs' warning and opened the door. The old woman stepped inside\nand said in honeyed tones, \"Why don't you try it on right now, my\nlittle rabbit? Look, I'll show you how it should be worn!\"\n\nPoor Snow White, innocent and trusting, stood there with\nsparkling eyes as the woman thrust the comb into her ebon hair.\nBut as soon as the comb touched her head, the poison began to\nwork, and Snow White sank to the floor unconscious.\n\n\"You paragon of beauty!\" muttered the Queen. \"That will do for\nyou, I think.\"\n\nShe hurried away just as the sun was sinking behind the seventh\nhill, and a few minutes later the dwarfs came trudging home from\nwork. When they saw Snow White lying there on the floor, they\nknew at once that the Queen had been there again. Quickly they\nsearched, and soon enough they found the glittering poisonous\ncomb which was still fastened in the girl's black hair. But at\nthe very moment that they pulled it out, the poison lost its\npower and Snow White opened her eyes and sat up, as well as ever\nbefore.\n\nWhen she told the seven dwarfs what had happened, they looked\nvery solemn and said, \"You can see, Snow White, it was not an old\nwoman who came, but the wicked Queen in disguise. So please, dear\nchild, beware! Buy nothing from anyone and let no one, no one at\nall, into the house while we're gone!\"\n\nAnd Snow White promised.\n\n*          *          *          *          *\n\nBy this time the Queen had reached her home and there she stood\nin front of her mirror and said:\n\n   \"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n   Who's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nand the mirror answered as before:\n\n   \"Thou art very fair, Oh Queen,\n   But the fairest ever seen\n   Dwells within the wooded glen\n   With the seven little men.\"\n\nWhen she heard this, the Queen trembled with rage and\ndisappointment. \"I must, I _will_ be the fairest in the\nland!\" she cried, and away she went to a lonely secret chamber\nwhere no one ever came. There, by means of her wicked witchery,\nshe fashioned an apple. A very beautiful apple it was, so waxy\nwhite and rosy red that it made one's mouth water to look at it.\nBut it was far from being as good as it looked, for it was so\nartfully made that half of it--the rosiest half--was full of\npoison.\n\nWhen the Queen had finished this apple she put it into a basket\nwith some ordinary apples, and disguised herself as a\npeasant-wife. She crossed the seven hills to the home of the\nseven dwarfs and knocked at the door as before.\n\nSnow White peeped out of the window and said, \"I am not allowed\nto let anyone in, nor to buy anything either--the seven dwarfs\nhave forbidden it.\"\n\n\"Suits me,\" said the peasant-wife, \"I can easily sell my fine\napples elsewhere. Here, I'll give you one for nothing.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Snow White, \"I'm not allowed to take anything from\nstrangers.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid? Of poison, perhaps?\" said the woman. \"See, I'll\ncut the apple in two and I myself will eat half of it to show you\nhow harmless it is. Here, you can have the nice rosy half, I'll\ntake the white part.\"\n\nBy this time Snow White's mouth was fairly watering for the\nluscious-looking fruit, and when the woman took a big bite out of\nthe white half and smacked her lips, the poor girl could bear it\nno longer. She stretched her little hand out through the window,\ntook the rosy half of the apple and bit into it. Immediately she\nsank to the floor and knew no more.\n\nWith a glance of glee and a laugh over-loud, the Queen cried,\n\"Now, you! White as snow, red as blood and black as\nebony--_now_ let the dwarfs revive you!\"\n\nShe could scarcely wait to get home to her mirror and say:\n\n   \"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n   Who's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nand to her joy it said:\n\n   \"Oh Queen, thou art the fairest in the land!\"\n\nNow there was peace at last in the heart of the Queen--that is,\nas much peace as can ever be found in a heart full of envy and\nhate.\n\n*          *          *          *          *\n\nAfter the wicked Queen had gone away, the sun sank down behind\nthe seventh hill and the dwarfs came trudging home from work.\nWhen they reached their little home, no light gleamed from its\nwindows, no\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

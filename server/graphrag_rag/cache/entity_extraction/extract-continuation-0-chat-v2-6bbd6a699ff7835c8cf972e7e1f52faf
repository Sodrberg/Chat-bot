The\nmountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\ncharm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\nLook at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\nisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\nthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\nhalf hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\nand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\npile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of\nour own country.”\n\nClerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and\nto dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a\nbeing formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and\nenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His\nsoul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that\ndevoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only\nin the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\nsatisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard\nonly with admiration, he loved with ardour:—\n\n    ——The sounding cataract\n    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\n    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\n    Their colours and their forms, were then to him\n    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,\n    That had no need of a remoter charm,\n    By thought supplied, or any interest\n    Unborrow’d from the eye.\n\n          [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]\n\nAnd where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost\nfor ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful\nand magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the\nlife of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist\nin my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and\nbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and\nconsoles your unhappy friend.\n\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\ntribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\noverflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will\nproceed with my tale.\n\nBeyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to\npost the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of\nthe river was too gentle to aid us.\n\nOur journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we\narrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.\nIt was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw\nthe white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;\nthey were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the\nremembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish\nArmada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard\nof even in my country.\n\nAt length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering\nabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 19\n\n\nLondon was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this\ntime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally\noccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\ncompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of\nintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most\ndistinguished natural philosophers.\n\nIf this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had\ncome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of\nthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interest\nwas so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I\ncould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of\nHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory\npeace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\nmy heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\nJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\nmy soul\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>LUCERNE<|>GEO<|>Lucerne is a lake in Switzerland known for its picturesque scenery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>URI<|>GEO<|>Uri is a region in Switzerland known for its lakes and mountains)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWITZERLAND<|>GEO<|>Switzerland is a country in Europe known for its mountains and lakes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICTOR<|>PERSON<|>Victor is the narrator of the story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLERALV<|>PERSON<|>Clerval is a friend of Victor's)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HENRY<|>PERSON<|>Henry is a friend of Victor's who has died)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LA VALEIS<|>GEO<|>La Valais is a region in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAIS DE VAUD<|>GEO<|>Pays de Vaud is a region in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIVINE RIVER<|>GEO<|>The divine river is a river in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTLE<|>GEO<|>The castle is a castle in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISLAND<|>GEO<|>The island is an island in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LABOURERS<|>PERSON<|>The labourers are people working in the vineyards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VILLAGE<|>GEO<|>The village is a village in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLACIER<|>GEO<|>The glacier is a glacier in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEAKS OF THE MOUNTAINS<|>GEO<|>The peaks of the mountains are the highest points of the mountains in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CATARACT<|>GEO<|>The cataract is a waterfall)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROCK<|>GEO<|>The rock is a rock in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOOD<|>GEO<|>The wood is a forest in Switzerland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TILBURY FORT<|>GEO<|>Tilbury Fort is a fort in England)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPANISH ARMADA<|>EVENT<|>The Spanish Armada was a naval invasion of England)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAVESEND<|>GEO<|>Gravesend is a town in England)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOOLWICH<|>GEO<|>Woolwich is a town in England)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREENWICH<|>GEO<|>Greenwich is a town in England)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST PAUL'S<|>GEO<|>St Paul's is a cathedral in London)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE TOWER<|>GEO<|>The Tower is a tower in London)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LUCERNE<|>URI<|>Lucerne and Uri are both regions in Switzerland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SWITZERLAND<|>LA VALEIS<|>Switzerland and La Valais are both countries in Europe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SWITZERLAND<|>PAIS DE VAUD<|>Switzerland and Pays de Vaud are both countries in Europe<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR<|>CLERALV<|>Victor and Clerval are friends<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR<|>HENRY<|>Victor and Henry are friends<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLERALV<|>HENRY<|>Clerval and Henry are friends<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LA VALEIS<|>PAIS DE VAUD<|>La Valais and Pays de Vaud are both regions in Switzerland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIVINE RIVER<|>CASTLE<|>The divine river and the castle are both in Switzerland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISLAND<|>LABOURERS<|>The island and the labourers are both in Switzerland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LABOURERS<|>VILLAGE<|>The labourers and the village are both in Switzerland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLACIER<|>PEAKS OF THE MOUNTAINS<|>The glacier and the peaks of the mountains are both in Switzerland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CATARACT<|>ROCK<|>The cataract and the rock are both in Switzerland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROCK<|>WOOD<|>The rock and the wood are both in Switzerland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TILBURY FORT<|>SPANISH ARMADA<|>Tilbury Fort and the Spanish Armada are both in England<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAVESEND<|>WOOLWICH<|>Gravesend and Woolwich are both towns in England<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WOOLWICH<|>GREENWICH<|>Woolwich and Greenwich are both towns in England<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ST PAUL'S<|>THE TOWER<|>St Paul's and the Tower are both in London<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

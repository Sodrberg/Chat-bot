And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window\nat the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three\ndrops of blood fell upon the snow.  And the red looked pretty\nupon the white snow, and she thought to herself, would that I had\na child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the\nwood of the window-frame.\n\nSoon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as\nsnow, and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony,\nand she was therefore called little snow-white.  And when the\nchild was born, the queen died.\n\nAfter a year had passed the king took to himself another wife.\nShe was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could\nnot bear that anyone else chould surpass her in beauty.  She\nhad a wonderful looking-glass, and when she stood in front of it\nand looked at herself in it, and said,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nThe looking-glass answered,\n          thou, o queen, art the fairest of all.\n\nThen she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke\nthe truth.\n\nBut snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful,\nand when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day,\nand more beautiful than the queen herself.  And once when the\nqueen asked her looking-glass,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nIt answered,\n          thou art fairer than all who are here, lady queen.\n          But more beautiful still is snow-white, as I ween.\n\nThen the queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with\nenvy.  From that hour, whenever she looked at snow-white, her\nheart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so much.\nAnd envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a\nweed, so that she had no peace day or night.  She called a\nhuntsman, and said, take the child away into the forest.  I will\nno longer have her in my sight.  Kill her, and bring me back her\nlung and liver as a token.  The huntsman obeyed, and took her away\nbut when he had drawn his knife, and was about to pierce\nsnow-white's innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, ah dear\nhuntsman, leave me my life.  I will run away into the wild forest,\nand never come home again.\n\nAnd as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and\nsaid, run away, then, you poor child.  The wild beasts will soon\nhave devoured you, thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had\nbeen rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for\nhim to kill her.  And as a young bear just then came running by\nhe stabbed it, and cut out its lung and liver and took them to the\nqueen as proof that the child was dead.  The cook had to salt them,\nand the wicked queen ate them, and thought she had eaten the lung\nand liver of snow-white.\n\nBut now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so\nterrified that she looked at all the leaves on the trees, and did\nnot know what to do.  Then she began to run, and ran over sharp\nstones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but\ndid her no harm.\n\nShe ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening,\nthen she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself.\nEverything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than\ncan be told.  There was a table on which was a white cover, and\nseven little plates, and on each plate a little spoon, moreover,\nthere were seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs.\nAgainst the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and\ncovered with snow-white counterpanes.\n\nLittle snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some\nvegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine\nout of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only.\nThen, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the\nlittle beds, but none of them suited her, one was too long,\nanother too short, but at last she found that the seventh one was\nright, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to\nsleep.\n\nWhen it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back.\nThey were seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for\nore.  They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light within\nthe cottage they saw that someone had been there, for everything\nwas not in the same order in which they had left it.\n\nThe first said, who has been sitting on my chair.\nThe second, who has been eating off my plate.\nThe third, who has been taking some of my bread.\nThe fourth, who has been eating my vegetables.\nThe fifth, who has been using my fork.\nThe sixth, who has been cutting with my knife.\nThe seventh, who has been drinking out of my mug.\n\nThen the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

Inside all was dark\nand silent--no lamps were lit and no supper was on the table.\nSnow White lay on the floor and no breath came from her lips.\n\nAt this sight the seven little dwarfs were filled with woe, for\nwell they knew that this was once more the work of the wicked\nQueen.\n\n\"We must save her!\" they cried, and hurried here and there. They\nlit their seven lights, then took Snow White and laid her on the\nbed. They searched for something poisonous but found nothing.\nThey loosened her bodice, combed her hair and washed her face\nwith water and wine, but nothing helped: the poor child did not\nmove, did not speak, did not open her eyes.\n\n\"Alas!\" cried the dwarfs. \"We have done all we could, and now\nSnow White is lost to us forever!\"\n\nGravely they shook their heads, sadly they stroked their beards,\nand then they all began to cry. They cried for three whole days\nand when at last they dried their tears, there lay Snow White,\nstill motionless to be sure, but so fresh and rosy that she\nseemed to be blooming with health.\n\n\"She is as beautiful as ever,\" said the dwarfs to each other,\n\"and although we cannot wake her, we must watch her well and keep\nher safe from harm.\"\n\nSo they made a beautiful crystal casket for Snow White to lie in.\nIt was transparent all over so that she could be seen from every\nside. On its lid they wrote in golden letters:\n\n   SNOW WHITE--A PRINCESS\n\nand when it was all finished they laid Snow White inside and\ncarried it to one of the seven hilltops. There they placed it\namong the trees and flowers, and the birds of the wood came and\nmourned for her, first an owl, then a raven, and last of all a\nlittle dove.\n\nNow only six little dwarfs went to dig in the hills every day,\nfor each in his turn stayed behind to watch over Snow White so\nthat she was never alone.\n\nWeeks and months and years passed by, and all this time Snow\nWhite lay in her crystal casket and did not move or open her\neyes. She seemed to be in a deep deep sleep, her face as fair as\na happy dream, her cheeks as rosy as ever. The flowers grew gaily\nabout her, the clouds flew blithely above. Birds perched on the\ncrystal casket and trilled and sang, the woodland beasts grew\ntame and came to gaze in wonder.\n\nSome one else came too and gazed in wonder--not a bird or a\nrabbit or a deer, but a young Prince who had lost his way while\nwandering among the seven hills. When he saw the motionless\nmaiden, so beautiful and rosy red, he looked and looked and\nlooked. Then he went to the dwarfs and said, \"Please let me take\nthis crystal casket home with me and I will give you all the gold\nyou may ask for.\"\n\nBut the dwarfs shook their heads and said, \"We would not give it\nup for all the riches in the world.\"\n\nAt this the Prince looked troubled and his eyes filled with\ntears.\n\n\"If you won't take gold,\" he said, \"then please give her to me\nout of the goodness of your golden hearts. I know not why, but my\nheart is drawn toward this beautiful Princess. If you will let me\ntake her home with me, I will guard and honor her as my greatest\ntreasure.\"\n\nWhen they heard this, the kind little dwarfs took pity on the\nPrince and made him a present of Snow White in her beautiful\ncasket.\n\nThe Prince thanked them joyfully and called for his servants.\nGently they placed the crystal casket on their shoulders, slowly\nthey walked away. But in spite of all their care, one of the\nservants made a false step and stumbled over a gnarly root. This\njoggled the casket, and the jolt shook the piece of poisoned\napple right out of Snow White's throat. And lo! she woke up at\nlast and was as well as ever. Then all by herself she opened the\nlid, sat up, and looked about her in astonishment.\n\nThe Prince rushed up and lifted her out of the casket. He told\nher all that had happened and begged her to be his bride. Snow\nWhite consented with sparkling eyes, so they rode away to the\nPrince's home where they prepared for a gay and gala wedding.\n\n*          *          *          *          *\n\nBut while this was going on in the Prince's castle, something\nelse was happening in that other castle where lived the wicked\nQueen. She had been invited to a mysterious wedding, so she\ndressed herself in her festive best and stood in front of her\nmirror and said:\n\n   \"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n   Who's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nand the mirror answered:\n\n   \"Thou art very fair, Oh Queen,\n   But the fairest ever seen\n   Is Snow White, alive and well,\n   Standing 'neath a wedding\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>QUEEN<|>PERSON<|>The Queen is the main antagonist of the story, known for her envy and hate)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNOW WHITE<|>PERSON<|>Snow White is a princess who is placed in a deep sleep by the Queen's poisoned apple)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRINCE<|>PERSON<|>A young Prince who finds Snow White and falls in love with her)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVEN LITTLE DWARFS<|>PERSON<|>Seven small men who live in a cottage and take care of Snow White)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNOW WHITE'S CRYSTAL CAKEST<|>GEO<|>A beautiful crystal casket that Snow White is placed in)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVEN HILLS<|>GEO<|>A range of hills where Snow White is placed in her casket)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRINCE'S CASTLE<|>GEO<|>The castle where the Prince lives and where Snow White is taken after she wakes up)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUEEN'S CASTLE<|>GEO<|>The castle where the wicked Queen lives)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN<|>SNOW WHITE<|>The Queen is the main antagonist who tries to kill Snow White with a poisoned apple<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINCE<|>SNOW WHITE<|>The Prince falls in love with Snow White and takes care of her<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SEVEN LITTLE DWARFS<|>SNOW WHITE<|>The dwarfs take care of Snow White and try to save her from the Queen's poison<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PRINCE<|>QUEEN<|>The Prince and the Queen are not directly related, but the Queen's actions affect the Prince's life<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN<|>MIRROR<|>The Queen talks to her mirror and asks who is the fairest of them all<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN<|>SNOW WHITE'S CRYSTAL CAKEST<|>The Queen's actions lead to Snow White being placed in the crystal casket<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN<|>SEVEN HILLS<|>The Queen's actions lead to Snow White being placed in the crystal casket on the seven hills<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN<|>PRINCE'S CASTLE<|>The Queen is not directly related to the Prince's castle, but her actions affect the Prince's life<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>QUEEN<|>QUEEN'S CASTLE<|>The Queen is the main character in her own castle<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

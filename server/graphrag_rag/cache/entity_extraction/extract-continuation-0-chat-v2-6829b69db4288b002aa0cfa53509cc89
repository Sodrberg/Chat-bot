Most\nof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\nshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\nIt was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\nto find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\nit was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when\nquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\na sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\nConcerning the picture she could give no account.\n\n“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and\nfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\nexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\nto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\nplaced in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\nenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\nwantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\nafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\njewel, to part with it again so soon?\n\n“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\nhope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\ncharacter, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed\nguilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\ninnocence.”\n\nSeveral witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\nthey spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\nsupposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\nforward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\ndispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\nwhen, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\nthe court.\n\n“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who\nwas murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\nwith his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may\ntherefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\nwhen I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\npretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\nknow of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\nin the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\ntwo years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\nbenevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\nher last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\nattended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\nthe admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\nuncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\nwarmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\nmost affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\nnotwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\non her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\nthe bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\nI should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value\nher.”\n\nA murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful\nappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\nfavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with\nrenewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She\nherself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own\nagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed\nin her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a\nminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\nbetrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the\nhorror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\nthe countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\nI rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did\nnot equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\nremorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\n\nI passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to\nthe court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal\nquestion, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\nvisit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine\nwas condemned.\n\nI cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before\nexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon\nthem adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\nheart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I\naddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\n“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a\ncase, but I\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>GEO<|>Geneva is a city where the narrator's cousin was forced to remain in a barn)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARN<|>GEO<|>A barn in Geneva where the narrator's cousin was forced to remain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILLIAM<|>PERSON<|>William is the narrator's brother who was murdered)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>PERSON<|>Elizabeth is the narrator's cousin who defended Justine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUSTINE<|>PERSON<|>Justine is the accused who was wrongly convicted of murder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MADAME FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Madame Frankenstein is Elizabeth's aunt who was nursed by Justine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Frankenstein is the narrator's father)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET WOMAN<|>PERSON<|>A market woman who questioned the narrator's cousin)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COURT<|>GEO<|>The court where Justine was tried and convicted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUDGE<|>PERSON<|>The judge who presided over Justine's trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WITNESS<|>PERSON<|>Witnesses who testified against Justine)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>BARN<|>The narrator's cousin was forced to remain in a barn in Geneva<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILLIAM<|>JUSTINE<|>Justine was accused of murdering William<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>JUSTINE<|>Elizabeth defended Justine during her trial<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>MADAME FRANKENSTEIN<|>Justine nursed Madame Frankenstein<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Justine was a member of the Frankenstein family<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARKET WOMAN<|>JUSTINE<|>The market woman questioned the narrator's cousin about Justine<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COURT<|>JUSTINE<|>Justine was tried and convicted in the court<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUDGE<|>JUSTINE<|>The judge presided over Justine's trial<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WITNESS<|>JUSTINE<|>Witnesses testified against Justine<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

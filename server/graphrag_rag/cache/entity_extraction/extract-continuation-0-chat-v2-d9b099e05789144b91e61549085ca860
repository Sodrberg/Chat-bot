Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\nwished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\ngreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\nonly instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I\ndid not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\nI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\namusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\nrepaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\nelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\nany other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns\nof a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How\ndifferent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\n\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\naccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\nand my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this\ndelay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\nfriends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an\nunwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\nacquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\ncheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came\nits beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.\n\nThe month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\nwhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\npedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a\npersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded\nwith pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\nhad always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\nthat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\n\nWe passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits\nhad long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\nsalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\nthe conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the\nintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\nClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\nme to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\nExcellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\nelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish\npursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\naffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\nwho, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.\nWhen happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\ndelightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with\necstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\nbloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I\nwas undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed\nupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\ninvincible burden.\n\nHenry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\nexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\nhis soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\nastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\nimitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\nfancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew\nme out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.\n\nWe returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were\ndancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were\nhigh, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\nOn my return, I found the following letter from my father:—\n\n“My dear Victor,\n\n“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can\nI relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\nson? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\n\n“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\nmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!\n\n“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\ncircumstances of the transaction.\n\n“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\nwalk in\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>VICTOR<|>PERSON<|>Victor is the narrator of the story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLERVAL<|>PERSON<|>Clerval is Victor's friend and companion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INGOLSTADT<|>GEO<|>Ingolstadt is a city where Victor and Clerval went on a pedestrian tour)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>GEO<|>Geneva is Victor's native town)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILLIAM<|>PERSON<|>William is Victor's younger brother who was murdered)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICTOR'S FATHER<|>PERSON<|>Victor's father is the one who wrote the letter to Victor about William's death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAY<|>EVENT<|>The month of May is significant in the story as it is when Victor's brother William was murdered)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THURSDAY<|>EVENT<|>Thursday, May 7th, is the day when William was murdered)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR<|>CLERVAL<|>Victor and Clerval were friends and companions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR<|>INGOLSTADT<|>Victor went on a pedestrian tour in Ingolstadt with Clerval<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR<|>GENEVA<|>Victor is from Geneva and longed to return there<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR<|>WILLIAM<|>Victor's brother William was murdered<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR'S FATHER<|>WILLIAM<|>Victor's father is grieving the loss of his son William<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR'S FATHER<|>VICTOR<|>Victor's father wrote a letter to Victor about William's death<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAY<|>WILLIAM<|>William was murdered in May<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THURSDAY<|>WILLIAM<|>William was murdered on a Thursday<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

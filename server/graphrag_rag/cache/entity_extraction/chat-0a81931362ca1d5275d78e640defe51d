The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\ntearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\nsearch of food.\n\n“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\nwell-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.\nI crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\naccustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun\nmounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I\ntrembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside\nof the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\nagony of this suspense.\n\n“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\nwhich differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix\napproached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\nhis discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.\n\n“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,\n‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose\nthe produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\nI beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\ndetermination.’\n\n“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can\nnever again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\ndanger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and\nmy sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason\nwith me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this\nplace.’\n\n“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion\nentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\ndeparted. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\n\n“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\nutter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken\nthe only link that held me to the world. For the first time the\nfeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\ncontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\nbent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,\nof the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\nexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\ntears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\ninjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As\nnight advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\nand after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\nI waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\noperations.\n\n“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\nalong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\nspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the\ndry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\nnearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\nbrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\nand bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\n\n“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\nthe habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.\n\n“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the\nthought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you\nwere my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\nthan to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had\nbestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\nthese the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\nYou had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\nthis place I resolved to proceed.\n\n“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\nonly guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

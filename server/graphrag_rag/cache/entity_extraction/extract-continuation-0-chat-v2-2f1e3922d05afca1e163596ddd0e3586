I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\nat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\nindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\nlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\nregions I am about to explore.\n\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\nI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\n\nYour affectionate brother,\n Robert Walton\n\n\n\n\nLetter 3\n\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\n\nJuly 7th, 17—.\n\n\nMy dear Sister,\n\nI write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced\non my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good\nspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\nexpected.\n\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a\nletter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and\nI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\n\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as\nyours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,\npersevering, and prudent.\n\nBut success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I\nhave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars\nthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not\nstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?\n\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must\nfinish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!\n\nR.W.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>ROBERT WALTON<|>PERSON<|>Robert Walton is a passionate and imaginative person who loves the marvellous and is on a voyage to explore the unvisited regions of the ocean)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARGARET<|>PERSON<|>Margaret is Robert Walton's sister, to whom he writes letters and expresses his love and affection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLAND<|>GEO<|>England is Robert Walton's native land, from which he may not see for many years)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARCHANGEL<|>GEO<|>Archangel is a place from which a merchantman is sailing back to England)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFRICA<|>GEO<|>Africa is a continent that Robert Walton may visit on his voyage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICA<|>GEO<|>America is a continent that Robert Walton may visit on his voyage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCEAN<|>GEO<|>The ocean is a vast body of water that Robert Walton is exploring)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT WALTON<|>ENGLAND<|>Robert Walton is from England and may not see it for many years<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT WALTON<|>MARGARET<|>Robert Walton writes letters to his sister Margaret and expresses his love and affection<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBERT WALTON<|>OCEAN<|>Robert Walton is on a voyage to explore the ocean<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGARET<|>ROBERT WALTON<|>Margaret is Robert Walton's sister, to whom he writes letters<|>9)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

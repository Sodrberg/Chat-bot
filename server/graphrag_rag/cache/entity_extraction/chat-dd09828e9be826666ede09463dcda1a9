And by the help of witchcraft, which she\nunderstood, she made a poisonous comb.  Then she disguised\nherself and took the shape of another old woman.  So she went\nover the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the\ndoor, and cried, good things to sell, cheap, cheap.  Little\nsnow-white looked out and said, go away, I cannot let anyone come\nin.  I suppose you can look, said the old woman, and pulled the\npoisonous comb out and held it up.  It pleased the girl so well\nthat she let herself be beguiled, and opened the door.  When they\nhad made a bargain the old woman said, now I will comb you\nproperly for once.  Poor little snow-white had no suspicion, and\nlet the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she put the\ncomb in her hair than the poison in it took effect, and the girl\nfell down senseless.  You paragon of beauty, said the wicked\nwoman, you are done for now, and she went away.\n\nBut fortunately it was almost evening, when the seven dwarfs\ncame home.  When they saw snow-white lying as if dead upon the\nground they at once suspected the step-mother, and they looked\nand found the poisoned comb.  Scarcely had they taken it out when\nsnow-white came to herself, and told them what had happened.\nThen they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open\nthe door to no one.\n\nThe queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nThen it answered as before,\n          oh, queen, thou art fairest of all I see,\n          but over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,\n          snow-white is still alive and well,\n          and none is so fair as she.\n\nWhen she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook\nwith rage.  Snow-white shall die, she cried, even if it costs me\nmy life.\n\nThereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room, where no\none ever came, and there she made a very poisonous apple.\nOutside it looked pretty, white with a red cheek, so that\neveryone who saw it longed for it, but whoever ate a piece of it\nmust surely die.\n\nWhen the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed herself\nup as a farmer's wife, and so she went over the seven\nmountains to the seven dwarfs.  She knocked at the door.  Snow-white\nput her head out of the window and said, I cannot let\nanyone in, the seven dwarfs have forbidden me.  It is all the\nsame to me, answered the woman, I shall soon get rid of my apples.\nThere, I will give you one.\n\nNo, said snow-white, I dare not take anything.  Are you afraid\nof poison, said the old woman, look, I will cut the apple in two\npieces, you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.  The\napple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was\npoisoned.  Snow-white longed for the fine apple, and when she saw\nthat the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer, and\nstretched out\nher hand and took the poisonous half.  But hardly had she a bit\nof it in her mouth than she fell down dead.  Then the queen\nlooked at her with a dreadful look, and laughed aloud and said,\nwhite as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood, this time the\ndwarfs cannot wake you up again.\n\nAnd when she asked of the looking-glass at home,\n          looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,\n          who in this land is the fairest of all.\n\nAnd it answered at last,\n          oh, queen, in this land thou art fairest of all.\nThen her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can\nhave rest.\n\nThe dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found snow-white\nlying upon the ground, she breathed no longer and was dead.\nThey lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find\nanything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her\nwith water and wine, but it was all of no use, the poor child was\ndead, and remained dead.  They laid her upon a bier, and all\nseven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days\nlong.\n\nThen they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she\nwere living, and still had her pretty red cheeks.

I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\nsight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\nsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\nyet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\nshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\nthat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\nIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\nto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\nwhich he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\n\nEver since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\nevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\nonly that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\nlife. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\nswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\nnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\nthousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\nof nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\nmyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\nwatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\nwere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\nsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\nand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\nforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\nsusceptible.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 22\n\n\nThe voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\ncould continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were\nindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to\nseek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not\nabhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\nangelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right\nto share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose\njoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they\nwould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know\nmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!\n\nMy father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by\nvarious arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I\nfelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of\nmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.\n\n“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. \nHuman beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such\na wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent\nas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\nof this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all\ndied by my hands.”\n\nMy father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of\ndelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\nitself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\nconvalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\nconcerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be\nsupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,\nbesides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\nhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of\nhis breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was\nsilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.\nYet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably\nfrom me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part\nrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.\n\nUpon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,\n“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat\nyou never to make such an assertion again.”\n\n“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.\nA thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

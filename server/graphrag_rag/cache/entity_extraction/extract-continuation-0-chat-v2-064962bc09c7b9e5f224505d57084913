Still, as I ascended higher,\nthe valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\nRuined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\nimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\namong the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was\naugmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\nshining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\nearth, the habitations of another race of beings.\n\nI passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river\nforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\noverhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This\nvalley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\npicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The\nhigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\nmore ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached\nthe road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\nmarked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and\nmagnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\nand its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.\n\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\njourney. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\nlighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing\naccents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the\nkindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief\nand indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my\nanimal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\nmyself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\nthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\n\nAt length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded\nto the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.\nFor a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid\nlightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\nthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds\nacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\nupon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed\nthe giver of oblivion.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\nI spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside\nthe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\nwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\nbarricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\nme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\nscattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\npresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\nwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\naccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\nwas ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\ntheir hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\ngreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me\nfrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\ngrief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they\ndiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\nlast month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\nwaited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\nhad contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\nunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\nand ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all\ngathered round me and bade me be at peace.\n\nWhere had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\nthought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\nmighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\nin their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\nMontanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\nIt had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\nsoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\nThe sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\neffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\ncares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.\n\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\nmountain. It is a scene terrifically\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##(\"entity\"<|>MONT BLANC<|>GEO<|>Mont Blanc is the supreme and magnificent mountain in the region)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>MONTANVERT<|>GEO<|>Montanvert is a village near the glacier)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>ARVE<|>GEO<|>Arve is a river in the region)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>ARVEIRON<|>GEO<|>Arveiron is a river that takes its rise in a glacier)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>GEO<|>Chamounix is a valley in the region)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>SERVOX<|>GEO<|>Servox is a valley in the region)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>PELISSIER<|>GEO<|>Pélissier is a bridge in the region)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>ALPS<|>GEO<|>Alps are a mountain range in the region)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>PINE WOODS<|>GEO<|>Pine woods are a type of forest in the region)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>EAGLE<|>PERSON<|>Eagle is a type of bird in the region)\n##\n##(\"entity\"<|>AUTHOR<|>PERSON<|>Author is the narrator of the story)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>MONT BLANC<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Mont Blanc overlooks the valley of Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>MONTANVERT<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Montanvert is a village near the valley of Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>ARVE<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Arve flows through the valley of Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>ARVEIRON<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Arveiron takes its rise in a glacier near Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>SERVOX<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Servox is a valley in the region near Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>PELISSIER<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Pélissier is a bridge in the region near Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>ALPS<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Alps are a mountain range in the region near Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>PINE WOODS<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Pine woods are a type of forest in the region near Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>EAGLE<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Eagle is a type of bird in the region near Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>CHAMOUNIX<|>Author visited the valley of Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>MONT BLANC<|>Author saw Mont Blanc from the valley of Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>MONTANVERT<|>Author visited Montanvert<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>ARVE<|>Author saw Arve in the valley of Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>ARVEIRON<|>Author saw Arveiron in the valley of Chamounix<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>SERVOX<|>Author visited Servox<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>PELISSIER<|>Author saw Pélissier in the region<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>ALPS<|>Author saw Alps in the region<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>PINE WOODS<|>Author saw pine woods in the region<|>8)\n##\n##(\"relationship\"<|>AUTHOR<|>EAGLE<|>Author saw eagle in the region<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

I will hover near and direct the\nsteel aright.\n\nWalton, _in continuation._\n\n\nAugust 26th, 17—.\n\n\nYou have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not\nfeel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles\nmine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\ntale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with\ndifficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes\nwere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow\nand quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his\ncountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a\ntranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\nof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\n\nHis tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,\nyet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,\nand the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a\ngreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,\nhowever earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!\nI cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I\nendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\ncreature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.\n\n“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your\nsenseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the\nworld a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek\nto increase your own.”\n\nFrankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked\nto see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,\nbut principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held\nwith his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said\nhe, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\nposterity.”\n\nThus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest\ntale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my\nsoul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale\nand his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe\nhim, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of\nevery hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can\nnow know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and\ndeath. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\ndelirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\nfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\nexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his\nfancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a\nremote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render\nthem to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.\n\nOur conversations are not always confined to his own history and\nmisfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays\nunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His\neloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates\na pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,\nwithout tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days\nof his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems\nto feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.\n\n“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for\nsome great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness\nof judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of\nthe worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\nfor I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that\nmight be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had\ncompleted, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\nanimal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But\nthis thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\nserves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes\nare as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am\nchained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of\nanalysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I\nconceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot\nrecollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod\nheaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea\nof their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\nambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once\nwas, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency\nrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\nnever, never again to rise.”\n\nMust I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert\nseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Frankenstein is the narrator of the story and the creator of the monster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARGARET<|>PERSON<|>Margaret is the narrator's friend who is listening to Frankenstein's story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FELIX<|>PERSON<|>Felix is a person mentioned in the letters shown to Margaret by Frankenstein)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAFIE<|>PERSON<|>Safie is a person mentioned in the letters shown to Margaret by Frankenstein)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MONSTER<|>PERSON<|>The monster is a creature created by Frankenstein)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALTON<|>PERSON<|>Walton is the narrator of the story and the one who is listening to Frankenstein's story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN'S CREATURE<|>PERSON<|>Frankenstein's creature is the monster created by Frankenstein)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALBERT FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Albert Frankenstein is the creator of the monster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SHIP<|>GEO<|>The ship is the vessel on which Walton and his crew are traveling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE DESERT SEAS<|>GEO<|>The desert seas are the location where Walton and his crew are traveling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE ARCTIC<|>GEO<|>The Arctic is the location where Walton and his crew are traveling)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CREATURE'S HOME<|>GEO<|>The creature's home is the location where the monster lives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CREATURE'S WORLD<|>GEO<|>The creature's world is the location where the monster lives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CREATURE'S HOME LAND<|>GEO<|>The creature's home land is the location where the monster lives)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>THE MONSTER<|>Frankenstein created the monster<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>MARGARET<|>Frankenstein is telling his story to Margaret<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>WALTON<|>Frankenstein is telling his story to Walton<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>FELIX<|>Frankenstein knows Felix through the letters he showed to Margaret<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>SAFIE<|>Frankenstein knows Safie through the letters he showed to Margaret<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGARET<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Margaret is listening to Frankenstein's story<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WALTON<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>Walton is listening to Frankenstein's story<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>ALBERT FRANKENSTEIN<|>Frankenstein is the creator of the monster<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE MONSTER<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>The monster was created by Frankenstein<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE SHIP<|>WALTON<|>The ship is the vessel on which Walton and his crew are traveling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE DESERT SEAS<|>WALTON<|>The desert seas are the location where Walton and his crew are traveling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE ARCTIC<|>WALTON<|>The Arctic is the location where Walton and his crew are traveling<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE'S HOME<|>THE MONSTER<|>The creature's home is the location where the monster lives<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE'S WORLD<|>THE MONSTER<|>The creature's world is the location where the monster lives<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE'S HOME LAND<|>THE MONSTER<|>The creature's home land is the location where the monster lives<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

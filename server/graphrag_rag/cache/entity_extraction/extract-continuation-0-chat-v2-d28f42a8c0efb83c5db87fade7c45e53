I was overcome by gloom\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\nremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\nconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\npenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\nthoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\nHis countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\nmine and addressed me in French,\n\n“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\nmake you more comfortable?”\n\n“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\nearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\n\n“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\n\n“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\nthe most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and\nhave been, can death be any evil to me?”\n\n“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\nstrange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\nsurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\nseized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was\npresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\nunaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\nyour path.”\n\nAs Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\nthis retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\nthe knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some\nastonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\nto say,\n\n“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\nyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\ntrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\nand illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\ndiscovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\nto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\nBut you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\nkind.”\n\n“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\ntell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\nnow to lament?”\n\n“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with\ngentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\n\nI know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\ninstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\nmisery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\nme to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,\nand cried out in agony,\n\n“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\nlet him enter!”\n\nMr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help\nregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\nrather a severe tone,\n\n“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\nwould have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\n\n“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\nfrom anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how\nvery kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\n\nMy change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\nthought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\nand now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and\nquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\n\nNothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\narrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\n\n“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”\n\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\ndwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\ncheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\nsaid he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\nof the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\nto pursue you. And poor Clerval—”\n\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\ngreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\n\n“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the\nmost horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\nshould have died on the coffin of Henry.”\n\nWe were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\ncould ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\ngradually recovered my health.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MR.

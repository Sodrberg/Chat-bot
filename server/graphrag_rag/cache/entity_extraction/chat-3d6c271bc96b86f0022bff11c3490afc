Our little voyages of discovery\nwere often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\nthemselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\nfield on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated\nfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\nof liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\nand the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\nand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\ninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\nmiserable self.\n\nWe left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\nplace of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\neverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\ndistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\nnative country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\nof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\nmanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name\nmade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\nMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\n\nFrom Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\nCumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the\nSwiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\nrocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we\nmade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\nhappiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\nmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\nin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\nimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\ninferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\nthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\n\nBut he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\namidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\n\nWe had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\nand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\nof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\nto travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my\npromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s\ndisappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\non my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\nfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited\nfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\nmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\nsaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\nread and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend\nfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\nWhen these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\nbut followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\nhis destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\nconsciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed\ndrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\n\nI visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\nhave interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\nas Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\nBut the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\ncastle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s\nSeat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\nthe change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\nimpatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\n\nWe left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\nBut I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\ntheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\nalone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\nrendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\nmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\ntime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\ncongenial to your own temper.”\n\nHenry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\nremonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with\nyou,” he said, “in\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\nfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\nthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\nsuch as no language can describe.\n\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never\nentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned\nthe face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;\nsolitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.\n\nMy father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition\nand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his\nserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and\nawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.\n“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer\nalso? No one could love a child more than I loved your\nbrother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but\nis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting\ntheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty\nowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,\nor even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\nsociety.”\n\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\nshould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my\nother sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of\ndespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.\n\nAbout this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\nparticularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at\nten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that\nhour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome\nto me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had\nretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the\nwater. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and\nsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to\npursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I\nwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only\nunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\nheavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\ninterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,\nI say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters\nmight close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,\nwhen I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\nloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my\nfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them\nexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose\namong them?\n\nAt these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that\ncould not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of\nunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had\ncreated should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling\nthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,\nwhich by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.\nThere was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained\nbehind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of\nhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to\nextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I\nreflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds\nof moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the\nAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished\nto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his\nhead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.\n\nOur house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply\nshaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\nthen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted\nand destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth\nwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our\nfuture prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from\nthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest\nsmiles.\n\n“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of\nJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\nappeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\ninjustice that I read in books or\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Victor Frankenstein is the protagonist of the story who created a monster and is now filled with remorse and guilt)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN'S FATHER<|>PERSON<|>Victor Frankenstein's father is a loving and concerned parent who tries to console his son)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIZABETH LAVINIA<|>PERSON<|>Elizabeth Lavinia is Victor Frankenstein's cousin and the woman he loves)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILLIAM FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>William Frankenstein is Victor Frankenstein's younger brother who was killed by the monster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUSTINE MORITZ<|>PERSON<|>Justine Moritz is a servant who was wrongly accused and executed for a crime committed by the monster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELRIVE<|>GEO<|>Belrive is the location of Victor Frankenstein's family home)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>GEO<|>Geneva is the city where Victor Frankenstein's family lives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAKE<|>GEO<|>The lake is a place where Victor Frankenstein often goes to escape his thoughts and feelings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONSTER<|>PERSON<|>The monster is a creature created by Victor Frankenstein who is now a source of guilt and fear for him)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>MONSTER<|>Victor Frankenstein created the monster and is now filled with remorse and guilt<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>ELIZABETH LAVINIA<|>Victor Frankenstein loves Elizabeth Lavinia and is motivated to protect her<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>WILLIAM FRANKENSTEIN<|>Victor Frankenstein's brother William was killed by the monster<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>JUSTINE MORITZ<|>The monster killed Justine Moritz, a servant who was wrongly accused<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>BELRIVE<|>Victor Frankenstein's family home is located in Belrive<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>GENEVA<|>Victor Frankenstein's family lives in Geneva<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>LAKE<|>Victor Frankenstein often goes to the lake to escape his thoughts and feelings<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN'S FATHER<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>Victor Frankenstein's father is a loving and concerned parent who tries to console his son<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIZABETH LAVINIA<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>Elizabeth Lavinia is the woman Victor Frankenstein loves<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILLIAM FRANKENSTEIN<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>William Frankenstein was Victor Frankenstein's younger brother<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE MORITZ<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>The monster killed Justine Moritz, a servant who was wrongly accused<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>The monster is a creature created by Victor Frankenstein who is now a source of guilt and fear for him<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>WILLIAM FRANKENSTEIN<|>The monster killed William Frankenstein<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>JUSTINE MORITZ<|>The monster killed Justine Moritz<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>ELIZABETH LAVINIA<|>The monster is a threat to Elizabeth Lavinia, the woman Victor Frankenstein loves<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

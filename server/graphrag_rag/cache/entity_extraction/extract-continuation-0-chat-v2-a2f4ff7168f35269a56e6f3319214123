Nay, you may have met with another\nwhom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to\nElizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear\nto feel.”\n\n“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and\nsincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my\nwarmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are\nentirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”\n\n“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\ngives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\na gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\nstrong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the\nmarriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\nfrom that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You\nare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words\nwith candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\nsincerity.”\n\nI listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable\nof offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\nthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me\nthe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\ndismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled\nand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not\nimpend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival\nwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the\nground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with\nhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from\nwhich I expected peace.\n\nI remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\nEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\nof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\nuse to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining\nthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I\nhad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my\nloathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar\nintercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful\naccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\nthrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I\nshould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\nharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my\nunearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus\nemployed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be\nrestored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,\nthe monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some\naccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\nslavery for ever.\n\nThese feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to\nvisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I\nclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\nurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\ncomply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\nresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\nthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,\nand he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my\nreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.\n\nThe duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\nat most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind\nprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without\npreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\narranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered\nwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\ncommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\nan impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\nhours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between\nme and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times\nforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\ncontemplate its progress?\n\nTo England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\nwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s\nage rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one\nreward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my\nunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\nenfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and\nforget the past in my union with her.\n\nI now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation.

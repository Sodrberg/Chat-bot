A flash of lightning\nilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\ngigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\nto humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\ndæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\nshuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\nidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\nchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\npassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\nhave destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\ndoubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\nfact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\nanother flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\nperpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\nsouth. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\n\nI remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still\ncontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I\nrevolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\nthe whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\nthe works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had\nnow nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\nwas this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a\ndepraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\nmurdered my brother?\n\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\nnight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not\nfeel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\nscenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast\namong mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\nof horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\nof my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\nto destroy all that was dear to me.\n\nDay dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were\nopen, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to\ndiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\nmade. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\nbeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\nmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I\nremembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\nthe time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\ndelirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that\nif any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\nlooked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature\nof the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\nas to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would\nbe pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\noverhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and\nI resolved to remain silent.\n\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I\ntold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\nto attend their usual hour of rising.\n\nSix years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\nstood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\ndeparture for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\nto me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\nmantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\ndesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\nby the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\nbut there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\nsentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\ntears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\nentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\n“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you\nhad come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\ndelighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\nalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\nsinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\nElizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor\nWilliam! he was our darling and our pride!”\n\nTears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\nagony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the\nwretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\na not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\nminutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\n\n“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>THE CREATURE<|>PERSON<|>The creature is a being created by Victor Frankenstein, with a will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as murder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Victor Frankenstein is the creator of the creature)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONT SALÊVE<|>GEO<|>Mont Salêve is a hill where the creature was seen hanging among the rocks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLAINPALAIS<|>GEO<|>Plainpalais is a region bounded by Mont Salêve on the south)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INGOLSTADT<|>GEO<|>Ingolstadt is a place where Victor Frankenstein went before his departure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAROLINE BEAUFORT<|>PERSON<|>Caroline Beaufort is the mother of Victor Frankenstein, depicted in a historical subject painting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILLIAM<|>PERSON<|>William is the brother of Victor Frankenstein, and the subject of a miniature painting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ERNEST<|>PERSON<|>Ernest is the brother of Victor Frankenstein, and welcomes him home)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>PERSON<|>Elizabeth is the cousin of Victor Frankenstein, and is accused of murder)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>The creature was created by Victor Frankenstein<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>MONT SALÊVE<|>Victor Frankenstein saw the creature hanging among the rocks of Mont Salêve<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>PLAINPALAIS<|>Victor Frankenstein was in Plainpalais when he saw the creature<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>INGOLSTADT<|>Victor Frankenstein went to Ingolstadt before his departure<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>CAROLINE BEAUFORT<|>Victor Frankenstein's mother is Caroline Beaufort<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>WILLIAM<|>Victor Frankenstein's brother is William<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>ERNEST<|>Victor Frankenstein's brother is Ernest<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>ELIZABETH<|>Victor Frankenstein's cousin is Elizabeth<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE<|>MONT SALÊVE<|>The creature was seen hanging among the rocks of Mont Salêve<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE<|>PLAINPALAIS<|>The creature was in Plainpalais when it was seen by Victor Frankenstein<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE<|>INGOLSTADT<|>The creature was not in Ingolstadt<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE<|>CAROLINE BEAUFORT<|>The creature was not created by Caroline Beaufort<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE<|>WILLIAM<|>The creature murdered William<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE<|>ERNEST<|>The creature did not murder Ernest<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREATURE<|>ELIZABETH<|>The creature accused Elizabeth of murder<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>ELIZABETH<|>Victor Frankenstein believes Elizabeth is accused of murder<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ERNEST<|>ELIZABETH<|>Ernest believes Elizabeth is accused of murder<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\nNo sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\nvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\noverflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\nbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\nbitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\ncontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\nwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\nmy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\nI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\nlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\nnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\ndegraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\nmalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\nfrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\ncreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\nvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\nfallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\nhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\n\n“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\ncrimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\nhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\nwasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\nnot satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\nI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no\ninjustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\nhumankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\nfriend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\nwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\nand immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\nabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\nblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\n\n“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and\nthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\ndeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have\ndevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\nadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\nirremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\nyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\nhands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\nimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\nwill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\n\n“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work\nis nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to\nconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\nbut it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\nsacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\nthither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall\ncollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its\nremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\ncreate such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the\nagonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet\nunquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no\nmore, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no\nlonger see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,\nfeeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my\nhappiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first\nopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the\nrustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to\nme, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by\ncrimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in\ndeath?\n\n“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these\neyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive\nand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better\nsatiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou\ndidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;\nand if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think\nand feel, thou wouldst not desire\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Frankenstein is the creator of the monster and is being addressed by the monster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONSTER<|>PERSON<|>The monster is a creature created by Frankenstein and is speaking to him)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FELIX<|>PERSON<|>Felix is a virtuous being who drove his friend from his door with contumely)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSTIC<|>PERSON<|>The rustic is a virtuous being who sought to destroy the saviour of his child)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATOR<|>PERSON<|>The creator is Frankenstein, the monster's creator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUE<|>EVENT<|>Virtue is a concept that the monster once aspired to but has now lost)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAPPINESS<|>EVENT<|>Happiness is a concept that the monster once aspired to but has now lost)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AFFECTION<|>EVENT<|>Affection is a concept that the monster once aspired to but has now lost)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOVE<|>EVENT<|>Love is a concept that the monster once aspired to but has now lost)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEATH<|>EVENT<|>Death is the fate that the monster desires for itself and its creator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUNERAL PILE<|>EVENT<|>The funeral pile is a structure that the monster plans to use to consume its own body)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICE RAFT<|>GEO<|>The ice raft is a vessel that brought the monster to its current location)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL<|>GEO<|>The global is the location where the monster plans to find its final resting place)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>MONSTER<|>Frankenstein created the monster and is being addressed by it<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>The monster is speaking to Frankenstein and expressing its desire for revenge<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>FELIX<|>The monster is comparing itself to Felix, a virtuous being who drove his friend from his door with contumely<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>RUSTIC<|>The monster is comparing itself to the rustic, a virtuous being who sought to destroy the saviour of his child<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>CREATOR<|>The monster is speaking to its creator and expressing its desire for revenge<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>VIRTUE<|>The monster is expressing its loss of virtue and its desire for death<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>HAPPINESS<|>The monster is expressing its loss of happiness and its desire for death<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>AFFECTION<|>The monster is expressing its loss of affection and its desire for death<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>LOVE<|>The monster is expressing its loss of love and its desire for death<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>DEATH<|>The monster is expressing its desire for death and its plan to consume its own body<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>FUNERAL PILE<|>The monster is planning to use the funeral pile to consume its own body<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>ICE RAFT<|>The monster is planning to use the ice raft to escape and find its final resting place<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>GLOBAL<|>The monster is planning to find its final resting place in the global<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

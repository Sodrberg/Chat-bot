They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\npromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my\ncourse southwards.\n\nThis speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived\nthe idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in\npossibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when\nFrankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly\nto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\nand his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,\nhe said,\n\n“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,\nso easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious\nexpedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was\nsmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and\nterror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth\nand your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and\nthese you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this\nwas it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the\nbenefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men\nwho encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,\nbehold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first\nmighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content\nto be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and\nperil; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm\nfiresides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come\nthus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove\nyourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your\npurposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your\nhearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it\nshall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\nmarked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and\nwho know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”\n\nHe spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed\nin his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\nyou wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were\nunable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had\nbeen said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously\ndesired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage\nwould return.\n\nThey retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and\nalmost deprived of life.\n\nHow all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than\nreturn shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my\nfate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never\nwillingly continue to endure their present hardships.\n\nSeptember 7th.\n\n\nThe die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.\nThus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back\nignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess\nto bear this injustice with patience.\n\nSeptember 12th.\n\n\nIt is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility\nand glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these\nbitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted\ntowards England and towards you, I will not despond.\n\nSeptember 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard\nat a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were\nin the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief\nattention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in\nsuch a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked\nbehind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from\nthe west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly\nfree. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native\ncountry was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,\nloud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the\ncause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they\nwill soon return to England.”\n\n“Do you, then, really return?”\n\n“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.”\n\n“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but\nsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\nsufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\nbed,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Frankenstein is the captain of the vessel and a brave man who encourages his crew to be heroes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CREW<|>PERSON<|>The crew of the vessel are men who are initially brave but later turn out to be cowards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE VESSEL<|>EVENT<|>The vessel is a ship that is trapped in ice and is on a perilous journey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE ICE<|>EVENT<|>The ice is a barrier that the vessel is trapped in and is a source of danger)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENGLAND<|>GEO<|>England is the destination of the crew's return journey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CREW'S FAMILIES<|>PERSON<|>The crew's families are the people they will return to with the stigma of defeat)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAVEN<|>GEO<|>Heaven is the source of the spirits that assist Frankenstein's vengeance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SPIRITS<|>PERSON<|>The spirits are supernatural beings that assist Frankenstein's vengeance)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>THE CREW<|>Frankenstein encourages the crew to be heroes and not cowards<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREW<|>THE CREW'S FAMILIES<|>The crew will return to their families with the stigma of defeat<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>HEAVEN<|>Frankenstein's vengeance is assisted by spirits from Heaven<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>THE SPIRITS<|>Frankenstein's vengeance is assisted by supernatural spirits<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREW<|>THE VESSEL<|>The crew is on a perilous journey on the vessel<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREW<|>THE ICE<|>The crew is trapped in the ice and is in danger<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE VESSEL<|>THE ICE<|>The vessel is trapped in the ice and is a source of danger<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENGLAND<|>THE CREW<|>The crew is returning to England<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CREW<|>ENGLAND<|>The crew is returning to England<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

Who can follow an\nanimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\nno man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\nthe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\nhas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”\n\n“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\nhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\nand destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\ncredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\npunishment which is his desert.”\n\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\n“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if\nit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\npunishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\nyourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\nmake up your mind to disappointment.”\n\n“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage\nis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\nloose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have\nbut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\nhis destruction.”\n\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\nmadness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\n\n“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of\nwisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”\n\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on\nsome other mode of action.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 24\n\n\nMy present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\nswallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\nendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\nallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\ndelirium or death would have been my portion.\n\nMy first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I\nwas happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\nhateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels\nwhich had belonged to my mother, and departed.\n\nAnd now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\nwhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I\nhave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon\nthe sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared\nnot die and leave my adversary in being.\n\nWhen I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,\nand I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\nwhat path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\nreposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\ngraves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\nobserver. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\ncast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\nmourner.\n\nThe deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\nrage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\nand to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass\nand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\nsacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\ndeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\nspirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,\nuntil he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will\npreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\nand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\neyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\nministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed\nand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\ntorments me.”\n\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>GEO<|>Geneva is the city where the narrator was happy and beloved)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALPS<|>GEO<|>The Alps are a mountain range where the narrator's enemy may be hiding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILLIAM<|>PERSON<|>William is one of the narrator's loved ones who was murdered)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>PERSON<|>Elizabeth is one of the narrator's loved ones who was murdered)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NARRATOR<|>PERSON<|>The narrator is seeking revenge for the murder of his loved ones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIENDISH ENEMY<|>PERSON<|>The narrator's enemy is a monster who murdered his loved ones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAGISTRATE<|>PERSON<|>The magistrate is a Genevan official who is skeptical of the narrator's story)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIND<|>EVENT<|>The wind is gently agitating the leaves of the trees in the cemetery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NIGHT<|>EVENT<|>The night is nearly dark and solemn in the cemetery)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTED SPIRITS<|>EVENT<|>The spirits of the dead are flitting around the narrator in the cemetery)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GENEVA<|>ALPS<|>The narrator's enemy may be hiding in the Alps near Geneva<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>WILLIAM<|>The narrator is seeking revenge for the murder of William<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>ELIZABETH<|>The narrator is seeking revenge for the murder of Elizabeth<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>FIENDISH ENEMY<|>The narrator is seeking revenge for the murder of his loved ones at the hands of the fiendish enemy<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAGISTRATE<|>NARRATOR<|>The magistrate is skeptical of the narrator's story<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>DEPARTED SPIRITS<|>The narrator is seeking the aid of the departed spirits in his quest for revenge<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>WIND<|>The narrator is standing in the cemetery with the wind gently agitating the leaves of the trees<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>NIGHT<|>The narrator is standing in the cemetery at night<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NARRATOR<|>DEPARTED SPIRITS<|>The narrator is standing in the cemetery with the departed spirits<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

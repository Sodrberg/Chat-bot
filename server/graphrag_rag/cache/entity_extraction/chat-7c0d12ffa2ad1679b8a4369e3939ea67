He saw my change of\nfeeling and continued,\n\n“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see\nus again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not\nthat of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;\nacorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will\nbe of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.\nWe shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\nman and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful\nand human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\nwantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,\nI now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment\nand persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”\n\n“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of\nman, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your\nonly companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\npersevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and\nyou will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,\nand you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.\nThis may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”\n\n“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by\nmy representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?\nI swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that\nwith the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and\ndwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions\nwill have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly\naway, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”\n\nHis words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and\nsometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when\nI saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my\nfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle\nthese sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I\nhad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\nwas yet in my power to bestow.\n\n“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not\nalready shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust\nyou? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by\naffording a wider scope for your revenge?”\n\n“How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If\nI have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;\nthe love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall\nbecome a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices\nare the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will\nnecessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel\nthe affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of\nexistence and events from which I am now excluded.”\n\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various\narguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which\nhe had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight\nof all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had\nmanifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my\ncalculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers\nand hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices\nwas a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a\nlong pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and\nmy fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.\nTurning to him, therefore, I said,\n\n“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,\nand every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall\ndeliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”\n\n“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of\nheaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my\nprayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your\nhome and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with\nunutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall\nappear.”\n\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in\nmy sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than\nthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the\nsea of ice.\n\nHis tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of\nthe horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\ntowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\nheart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the\nlittle paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced\nperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences\nof the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

If she\nis, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\nactivity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\npartiality.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\ncommence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\nignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\nexculpated her who suffered through me.\n\nThe appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\nseated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\nher utter guiltlessness.\n\nThe trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\ncharge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\nagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\nof her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\nwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\nmurdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\ndid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\nand unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\no’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\nif anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\nfell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The\npicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\nand when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\nwhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\nhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\n\nJustine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\ncountenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\nexpressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\ndesired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\nalthough variable voice.\n\n“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I\ndo not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\non a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\nagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\njudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\ndoubtful or suspicious.”\n\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\nhouse of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from\nGeneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\nher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was\nalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\nwhen the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\nseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\nunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most\nof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\nshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\nIt was dawn, and she quitted her asylum\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>WILLIAM<|>PERSON<|>William is the deceased child)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>PERSON<|>Elizabeth is the narrator's sister and Justine's friend)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUSTINE<|>PERSON<|>Justine is the accused of the murder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NARRATOR<|>PERSON<|>The narrator is the one who is guilty of the crime but is absent when it was committed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE FATHER<|>PERSON<|>The father is the narrator's father and a judge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE COURT<|>GEO<|>The court is where the trial is taking place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GENEVA<|>GEO<|>Geneva is the city where the narrator lives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHÊNE<|>GEO<|>Chêne is a village near Geneva where Justine spent the evening)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MARKET WOMAN<|>PERSON<|>The market woman is a witness who saw Justine on the night of the murder)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SERVANT<|>PERSON<|>The servant is a witness who found a picture in Justine's pocket)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE ADVOCATE<|>PERSON<|>The advocate is the one who is against Justine)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILLIAM<|>JUSTINE<|>Justine is accused of killing William<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>JUSTINE<|>Elizabeth is Justine's friend and believes in her innocence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>THE NARRATOR<|>Justine is accused of a crime committed by the narrator<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE FATHER<|>JUSTINE<|>The father is a judge and is trying to prove Justine's innocence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>CHÊNE<|>Justine spent the evening at Chêne<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>GENEVA<|>Justine was in Geneva on the night of the murder<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>THE MARKET WOMAN<|>The market woman saw Justine on the night of the murder<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>THE SERVANT<|>The servant found a picture in Justine's pocket<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>THE ADVOCATE<|>The advocate is against Justine<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE NARRATOR<|>JUSTINE<|>The narrator is guilty of the crime but is absent when it was committed<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE FATHER<|>JUSTINE<|>The father is trying to prove Justine's innocence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>JUSTINE<|>Elizabeth believes in Justine's innocence<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>WILLIAM<|>Justine is accused of killing William<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

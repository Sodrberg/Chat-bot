Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to\nthe will of heaven!”\n\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,\nwhere I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!\nWho dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\nthe awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\ndeep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\nuttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When\nshe saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very\nkind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”\n\nI could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more\nconvinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you\nhad confessed, he did not credit it.”\n\n“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest\ngratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is\nthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than\nhalf my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my\ninnocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”\n\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed\ngained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the\nnever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\nconsolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\nthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\nmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and\ndespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\nme which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with\nJustine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\nherself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I\ncannot live in this world of misery.”\n\nJustine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\nrepressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice\nof half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,\nmy beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and\npreserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever\nsuffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”\n\nAnd on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence\nfailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\ncriminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant\nappeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers\nand heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed\navowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,\nbut not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She\nperished on the scaffold as a murderess!\n\nFrom the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my\nfather’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was\nthe work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these\nare not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and\nthe sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!\nFrankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he\nwho would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no\nthought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear\ncountenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life\nin serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond\nhis hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction\npause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!\n\nThus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,\nI beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and\nJustine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\nNothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have\nbeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\ninaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope\nand fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed\nfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\nheart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\nlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\ndescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet\nbehind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.\nI had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\nbeings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\nfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\nthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\nsuch as no language can describe\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>JUSTINE<|>PERSON<|>Justine is a woman who was wrongly accused and executed for a crime she did not commit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>PERSON<|>Elizabeth is a woman who is a friend of Justine and is deeply affected by her death)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WILLIAM<|>PERSON<|>William is a person who was a victim of the narrator's unhallowed arts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Frankenstein is the narrator's name and he is a person who is filled with remorse and horror for his actions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NARRATOR<|>PERSON<|>The narrator is a person who is a scientist and has committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE JUDGES<|>PERSON<|>The judges are a group of people who are responsible for the execution of Justine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NARRATOR'S FATHER<|>PERSON<|>The narrator's father is a person who is affected by the narrator's actions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOME<|>GEO<|>Home is the place where the narrator's family lives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAVE<|>GEO<|>Grave is the place where William and Justine are buried)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SACRIFICE<|>EVENT<|>Sacrifice is the event where Justine is executed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEATH<|>EVENT<|>Death is the event where William and Justine die)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>ELIZABETH<|>Justine and Elizabeth are friends and Elizabeth is deeply affected by Justine's death<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>WILLIAM<|>Justine and William are victims of the narrator's unhallowed arts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>JUSTINE<|>Frankenstein is the narrator who is responsible for Justine's death<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>WILLIAM<|>Frankenstein is the narrator who is responsible for William's death<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>ELIZABETH<|>Frankenstein is the narrator who is responsible for Elizabeth's pain and suffering<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>HOME<|>Frankenstein is the narrator who is responsible for the destruction of his home<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>GRAVE<|>Frankenstein is the narrator who is responsible for the death of William and Justine and their burial in the grave<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>GRAVE<|>Justine is a person who is buried in the grave<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILLIAM<|>GRAVE<|>William is a person who is buried in the grave<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>GRAVE<|>Elizabeth is a person who visits the grave of William and Justine<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>DEATH<|>Frankenstein is the narrator who is responsible for the death of William and Justine<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>DEATH<|>Justine is a person who dies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILLIAM<|>DEATH<|>William is a person who dies<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>DEATH<|>Elizabeth is a person who is affected by the death of William and Justine<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FRANKENSTEIN<|>SACRIFICE<|>Frankenstein is the narrator who is responsible for the sacrifice of Justine<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUSTINE<|>SACRIFICE<|>Justine is a person who is sacrificed<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WILLIAM<|>SACRIFICE<|>William is a person who is a victim of the narrator's unhallowed arts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>SACRIFICE<|>Elizabeth is a person who is affected by the sacrifice of Justine<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

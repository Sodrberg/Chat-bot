She began\nto run, over jagged stones and through thorny thickets. She\npassed many wild animals on the way, but they did not hurt her.\nShe ran all day, through woods and woods and over seven high high\nhills. At last, just at sunset, she came upon a tiny hut in a\nwooded glen. The door was open and there was no one at home, so\nshe thought she would stay and rest herself a little.\n\nShe went in and looked around. Everything was very small inside,\nbut as neat and charming as could be, and very very clean. At one\nend of the room stood a table decked in white, and on it were\nseven little plates, seven little knives and forks and spoons,\nand seven little goblets. In front of the table, each in its\nplace, were seven little chairs; and at the far side of the room\nwere seven beds, one beside the other, all made up with coverlets\nas pure and white as plum blossoms.\n\nSnow White was hungry and thirsty, so she took from each little\nplate a bit of vegetable and a bite of bread, and from each\nlittle goblet a sip of sweet wine. She had become very tired,\ntoo, from all her running, and felt like taking a nap. She tried\none bed after another but found it hard to choose the one which\nreally suited her.\n\nThe first little bed was too hard.\n\nThe second little bed was too soft.\n\nThe third little bed was too short.\n\nThe fourth little bed was too narrow.\n\nThe fifth little bed was too flat.\n\nThe sixth little bed was too fluffy.\n\nBut the seventh little bed was just right so she lay down in it\nand was soon fast asleep.\n\nAfter the sun had set behind the seventh hilltop and darkness had\ncrept into the room, the masters of the little hut came\nhome--they were seven little dwarfs who dug all day and hacked\naway at the hills, in search of gems and gold. They lit their\nseven little lights and saw right away that someone had been\nthere, for things were not quite the same as they had left them\nin the morning.\n\nSaid the first little dwarf, \"Who's been sitting in my chair?\"\n\nSaid the second little dwarf, \"Who's been eating from my plate?\"\n\nSaid the third, \"Who's been nibbling at my bread?\"\n\nSaid the fourth, \"Who's been tasting my vegetables?\"\n\nSaid the fifth, \"Who's been eating with my fork?\"\n\nAnd the sixth, \"Who's been cutting with my knife?\"\n\nAnd the seventh, \"Who's been drinking from my little goblet?\"\n\nNow the first little dwarf turned around, and saw a hollow in his\nbed and said, \"Someone's been sleeping in my bed.\"\n\nAnd the second little dwarf looked at his bed and said,\n\"Someone's been sleeping in mine too. It's rumpled.\"\n\nAnd the third said, \"In mine too, it's all humped up and\ncrumpled.\"\n\nAnd the fourth said, \"In mine too. It's full of wrinkles.\"\n\nAnd the fifth said, \"And mine. It's full of crinkles.\"\n\nAnd the sixth said, \"Mine too. It's all tumbled up and jumbled.\"\n\nBut the seventh cried, \"Well, someone's been sleeping in my bed,\nAND HERE SHE IS!\"\n\nThe others came crowding around, murmuring and whispering in\nwonderment at the sight. \"Ei! Ei!\" they said, \"how beautiful is\nthis child!\" They brought their tiny lights and held them high,\nand looked and looked and looked. So pleased were they with their\nnew little guest that they did not even wake her, but let her\nsleep in the bed all night. The seventh dwarf now had no bed, to\nbe sure, but he slept with his comrades, one hour with each in\nturn until the night was over.\n\nIn the morning when Snow White awoke and saw seven little men\ntiptoeing about the room, she was frightened, but not for long.\nShe soon saw that they were friendly little folk, so she sat up\nin bed and smiled at them. Now that she was awake and well\nrested, she looked more lovely than ever, with her rosy cheeks\nand big black eyes. The seven little dwarfs circled round her in\nnew admiration and awe, and said, \"What is your name, dear\nchild?\"\n\n\"They call me Snow White,\" said she.\n\n\"And how did you find your way to our little home?\" asked the\ndwarfs. So she told them her story.\n\nAll seven stood around and listened, nodding their heads and\nstroking their long long beards, and then they said, \"Do you\nthink you could be our little housekeeper--cook and knit and sew\nfor us, make up our beds and wash our little clothes? If you will\nkeep everything tidy and homelike, you can stay with us, and\nyou shall want for nothing in the world.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, with all my heart!\" cried Snow White. So there she\nstayed, and washed and sewed and knitted\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

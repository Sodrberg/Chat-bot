How would such a\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\n\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\nin my enterprise.\n\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\nwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\ninclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\notherwise he would command.\n\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\n\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\nI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mixtral-8x7b-32768", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

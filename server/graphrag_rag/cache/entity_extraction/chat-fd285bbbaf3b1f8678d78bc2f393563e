At a castle window framed in\nebony sat a young Queen working at her embroidery, and as she was\nstitching away and gazing at the snowflakes now and then, she\npricked her finger and three little drops of blood fell down upon\nthe snow. And because the red color looked so beautiful there on\nthe snow she thought to herself, \"Oh, if I only had a little\nchild as white as snow, as rosy red as blood, and with hair as\nebon black as the window frame!\"\n\nSoon after this a baby girl was born to her--a little Princess\nwith hair of ebon black, cheeks and lips of rosy red, and a skin\nso fine and fair that she was called Snow White. But when the\nchild was born the Queen died.\n\nAfter a year had passed, the King married a second time. His new\nwife, who was now Queen, was very beautiful but haughty and proud\nand vain--indeed, her only wish in life was to be the fairest in\nthe land. She had a mirror, a magic one, and when she looked in\nit she would say:\n\n   \"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n   Who's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nand the mirror would reply:\n\n   \"Oh Queen, thou art the fairest in the land.\"\n\nWith this the Queen was well content for she knew that her mirror\nalways spoke the truth.\n\nThe years flowed on, and all this time Snow White was growing\nup--and growing more beautiful each year besides. When she was\nseven years old she was fair as the day, and there came a time\nwhen the Queen stood in front of her mirror and said:\n\n   \"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n   Who's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nand this time the mirror answered:\n\n   \"Queen, thou art of beauty rare\n   But Snow White with ebon hair\n   Is a thousand times more fair.\"\n\nAt this the Queen became alarmed and turned green and yellow with\nenvy. And whenever she saw Snow White after that, her heart\nturned upside down within her--that was how much she hated the\ninnocent child for her beauty. These envious feelings grew like\nweeds in the heart of the Queen until she had no peace by day or\nby night. At last she could bear it no longer. She sent for a\nroyal huntsman and told him to take the child into the woods and\ndo away with her. \"And bring me a token,\" she added, \"so that I\nmay be sure you've obeyed me.\"\n\nSo the huntsman called Snow White and led her into the woods but\nbefore he could harm her, she burst into tears and said, \"Oh\nplease, dear hunter, have mercy! If you will let me go, I'll\ngladly wander away, far away into the wildwood and I'll never\ncome back again.\"\n\nThe huntsman was glad enough to help the sweet innocent girl, so\nhe said, \"Well, run away then, poor child, and may the beasts of\nthe wood have mercy on you.\" As a token he brought back the heart\nof a wild boar, and the wicked Queen thought it was Snow White's.\nShe had it cooked and ate it, I am sorry to say, with salt and\ngreat relish.\n\n*          *          *          *          *\n\nLittle Snow White wandered off into the depths of the wildwood.\nAbove her were leaves and leaves and leaves, about her\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

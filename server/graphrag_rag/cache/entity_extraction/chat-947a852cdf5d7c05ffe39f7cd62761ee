She was\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\nand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\nturn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\nby the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\nLife is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\nonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.\n\nWhen I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\ncountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\nappeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I\nescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\nwife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\nposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\nher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\nsupposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\nthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\nin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\nThe murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the\nbreath had ceased to issue from her lips.\n\nWhile I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\nThe windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\npanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\nThe shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\ndescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\nA grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\nfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\nthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\nleaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\nplunged into the lake.\n\nThe report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\nthe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\nboats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we\nreturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\nform conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to\nsearch the country, parties going in different directions among the\nwoods and vines.\n\nI attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\nhouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\nman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\neyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\nwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\nhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\nI had lost.\n\nAfter an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\nwhere the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I\nhung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\ndistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\nvarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\ncause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death\nof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\nof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\nfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\nmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\nfeet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started\nup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\n\nThere were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\nwind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\nhardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\nto row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\nmental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\nand the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\nexertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\nto every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\nfamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\nbefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\nTears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\nthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\nthen been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\na great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\nbut nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\nsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\nso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\nman.\n\nBut why should I dwell upon the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

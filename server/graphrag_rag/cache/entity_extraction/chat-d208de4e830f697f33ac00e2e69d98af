You\nraise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,\nI shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow\ncreatures.’\n\n“‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only\ndrive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am\nunfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;\njudge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’\n\n“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips\nfirst have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall\nbe for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success\nwith those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’\n\n“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’\n\n“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to\nrob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for\nfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\nremaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that\nmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment\nto lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the\ntime! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I\nseek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’\n\n“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’\n\n“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\nAgatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on\nbeholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her\nfriend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with\nsupernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in\na transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently\nwith a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends\nthe antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and\nI refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,\novercome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general\ntumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”\n\n\n\n\nChapter 16\n\n\n“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I\nnot extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly\nbestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my\nfeelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have\ndestroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with\ntheir shrieks and misery.\n\n“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\nanguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken\nthe toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging\nthrough the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable\nnight I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees\nwaved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird\nburst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest\nor in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\nfinding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\nhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\nthe ruin.\n\n“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\nthe sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\ntowards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\nagainst the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.\n\n“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid\nmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\nto reflection on my situation.\n\n“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\nconclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that\nmy conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a\nfool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I\nought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\nhave discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\nbeen prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be\nirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\ncottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\nparty.\n\n“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\npeaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\ntearing\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\nineffectual light.\n\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\nof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\nsubject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\nto your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\nknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\nwill allow.\n\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\nAlthough I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\nprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\nfibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\ndifficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\ncreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\nimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\ndoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\nas man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\nultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\nplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\nattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor\ncould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\nargument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I\nbegan the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts\nformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\nintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\nabout eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having\nformed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\ncollecting and arranging my materials, I began.\n\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\npour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\nowe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\n\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\nwith unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\nperson had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\nnext day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\nclay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\nreturned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\nframe. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.\n\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\none pursuit. It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>PERSON<|>The author is the narrator of the story and is describing their experience of creating life)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATURE<|>GEO<|>Nature is the source of the materials and inspiration for the author's creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE GRAVE<|>GEO<|>The grave is a source of materials for the author's creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HUMAN FRAME<|>GEO<|>The human frame is the subject of the author's study and creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CHARNEL-HOUSE<|>GEO<|>The charnel-house is a source of materials for the author's creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SLAUGHTER-HOUSE<|>GEO<|>The slaughter-house is a source of materials for the author's creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE WORKSHOP<|>GEO<|>The workshop is the location of the author's creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE DISSECTING ROOM<|>GEO<|>The dissecting room is a source of materials for the author's creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SUMMER<|>EVENT<|>The summer is the time period during which the author is engaged in their creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE VINTAGE<|>EVENT<|>The vintage is a seasonal event that the author is unaware of)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HARVEST<|>EVENT<|>The harvest is a seasonal event that the author is unaware of)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>NATURE<|>The author is inspired by nature and uses it as a source of materials for their creation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>THE GRAVE<|>The author uses the grave as a source of materials for their creation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>THE HUMAN FRAME<|>The author studies and creates life from the human frame<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>THE CHARNEL-HOUSE<|>The author uses the charnel-house as a source of materials for their creation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>THE SLAUGHTER-HOUSE<|>The author uses the slaughter-house as a source of materials for their creation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>THE WORKSHOP<|>The author creates life in their workshop<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>THE DISSECTING ROOM<|>The author uses the dissecting room as a source of materials for their creation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>THE SUMMER<|>The author is engaged in their creation during the summer<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>THE VINTAGE<|>The author is unaware of the vintage<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE AUTHOR<|>THE HARVEST<|>The author is unaware of the harvest<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

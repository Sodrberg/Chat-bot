I do break my promise; never will I create another like\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”\n\n“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\nunworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\nday will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;\nobey!”\n\n“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\narrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\nthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\nvice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose\ndelight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your\nwords will only exasperate my rage.”\n\nThe monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\nimpotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a\nwife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had\nfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\nMan! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\nand soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\never. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\nwretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\nremains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but\nfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\nmisery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with\nthe wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\nrepent of the injuries you inflict.”\n\n“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.\nI have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend\nbeneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”\n\n“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\nwedding-night.”\n\nI started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”\n\nI would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\nprecipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot\nacross the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the\nwaves.\n\nAll was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\npursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I\nwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\nfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him\nto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered\nto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\nAnd then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on\nyour wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the\nfulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\nextinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\nthought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\nshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\nhad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\nbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle.\n\nThe night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\ncalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\nthe depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\nnight’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\ncreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\ndesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\nbut uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\nbe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\ndæmon whom I had myself created.\n\nI walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\nloved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the\nsun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\nsleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\nwere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep\ninto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\nif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\nreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\nwords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\nlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\n\nThe sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>MONSTER<|>PERSON<|>The monster is a creature created by Victor Frankenstein, equal in deformity and wickedness)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>PERSON<|>Victor Frankenstein is the creator of the monster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELIZABETH<|>PERSON<|>Elizabeth is the beloved of Victor Frankenstein)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEDDING-NIGHT<|>EVENT<|>The wedding-night is the period fixed for the fulfilment of Victor Frankenstein's destiny)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAINLAND<|>GEO<|>The mainland is the destination of the monster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCEAN<|>GEO<|>The ocean is the barrier between Victor Frankenstein and his fellow creatures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISLE<|>GEO<|>The isle is the place where Victor Frankenstein walks like a restless spectre)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>The monster is a creature created by Victor Frankenstein<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>ELIZABETH<|>Victor Frankenstein loves Elizabeth<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>WEDDING-NIGHT<|>The monster threatens to be present at Victor Frankenstein's wedding-night<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>MAINLAND<|>The monster is heading towards the mainland<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MONSTER<|>OCEAN<|>The monster is on the ocean<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN<|>ISLE<|>Victor Frankenstein walks on the isle like a restless spectre<|>2)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

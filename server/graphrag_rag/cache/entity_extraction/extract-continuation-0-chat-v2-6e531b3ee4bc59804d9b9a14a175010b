The\npossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\nstudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\nemployed in their ordinary occupations.\n\n“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced\nin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\nto ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In\nthe _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\nstory, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\nwhat had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\nnever-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and\ndomestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\nfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\nwell with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a\nmore divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\ncontained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon\ndeath and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not\npretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\nthe opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\nunderstanding it.\n\n“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\ncondition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\nunlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\nwas a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\nwas unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\n‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my\nannihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did\nthis mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\ndestination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\nsolve them.\n\n“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book\nhad a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I\nlearned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\ntaught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\nown reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many\nthings I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very\nconfused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\nand boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\nlarge assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\nonly school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\ndeveloped new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned\nin public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the\ngreatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\nfar as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\nwere, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these\nfeelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\nSolon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The\npatriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\nfirm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\nbeen made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\nhave been imbued with different sensations.\n\n“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\na true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\npicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\nexciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\nstruck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\nany other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\nin every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a\nperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\nhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\nbeings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\nMany times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\ngall of envy rose within me.\n\n“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon\nafter my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\nthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had\nneglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\nwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was\nyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You\nminutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\nof your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\noccurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.\nEverything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## (\"entity\"<|>THE COTTAGE<|>GEO<|>The cottage was the place where the narrator acquired knowledge and studied)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLUTARCH'S LIVES<|>EVENT<|>Plutarch's Lives is a book that taught the narrator about high thoughts and heroes of past ages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARADISE LOST<|>EVENT<|>Paradise Lost is a book that excited deep emotions in the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NUMA<|>PERSON<|>Numa is a lawgiver who was admired by the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOLON<|>PERSON<|>Solon is a lawgiver who was admired by the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYCURGUS<|>PERSON<|>Lycurgus is a lawgiver who was admired by the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROMULUS<|>PERSON<|>Romulus is a lawgiver who was not admired by the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THESEUS<|>PERSON<|>Theseus is a lawgiver who was not admired by the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADAM<|>PERSON<|>Adam is a character in Paradise Lost who was similar to the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SATAN<|>PERSON<|>Satan is a character in Paradise Lost who was similar to the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NARRATOR<|>PERSON<|>The narrator is a creature who was created by the scientist and was alone and helpless)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SCIENTIST<|>PERSON<|>The scientist is the creator of the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE LABORATORY<|>GEO<|>The laboratory is the place where the scientist created the narrator)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HOVEL<|>GEO<|>The hovel is the place where the narrator lived after being created)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE COTTAGE<|>PLUTARCH'S LIVES<|>The cottage is where the narrator studied Plutarch's Lives<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE COTTAGE<|>PARADISE LOST<|>The cottage is where the narrator studied Paradise Lost<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NUMA<|>SOLON<|>Numa and Solon are lawgivers who were admired by the narrator<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NUMA<|>LYCURGUS<|>Numa and Lycurgus are lawgivers who were admired by the narrator<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOLON<|>LYCURGUS<|>Solon and Lycurgus are lawgivers who were admired by the narrator<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADAM<|>SATAN<|>Adam and Satan are characters in Paradise Lost who were similar to the narrator<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE NARRATOR<|>ADAM<|>The narrator and Adam are similar characters in Paradise Lost<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE NARRATOR<|>SATAN<|>The narrator and Satan are similar characters in Paradise Lost<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE SCIENTIST<|>THE NARRATOR<|>The scientist created the narrator<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE LABORATORY<|>THE NARRATOR<|>The laboratory is where the scientist created the narrator<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE HOVEL<|>THE NARRATOR<|>The hovel is where the narrator lived after being created<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

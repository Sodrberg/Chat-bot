DWARFS\n\nOnce upon a time, in the middle of winter, the snowflakes were falling like feathers from the sky. At a castle window framed in ebony sat a young Queen working at her embroidery, and as she was stitching away and gazing at the snowflakes now and then, she pricked her finger and three little drops of blood fell down upon the snow. And because the red color looked so beautiful there on the snow she thought to herself, \"Oh, if I only had a little child as white as snow, as rosy red as blood, and with hair as ebon black as the window frame!\"\n\nSoon after this a baby girl was born to her--a little Princess with hair of ebon black, cheeks and lips of rosy red, and a skin so fine and fair that she was called Snow White. But when the child was born the Queen died.\n\nAfter a year had passed, the King married a second time. His new wife, who was now Queen, was very beautiful but haughty and proud and vain--indeed, her only wish in life was to be the fairest in the land. She had a mirror, a magic one, and when she looked in it she would say:\n\n\"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n\nWho's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nand the mirror would reply:\n\n\"Oh Queen, thou art the fairest in the land.\"\n\nWith this the Queen was well content for she knew that her mirror always spoke the truth.\n\nThe years flowed on, and all this time Snow White was growing up--and growing more beautiful each year besides. When she was seven years old she was fair as the day, and there came a time when the Queen stood in front of her mirror and said:\n\n\"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n\nWho's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nand this time the mirror answered:\n\n\"Queen, thou art of beauty rare\n\nBut Snow White with ebon hair\n\nIs a thousand times more fair.\"\n\nAt this the Queen became alarmed and turned green and yellow with envy. And whenever she saw Snow White after that, her heart turned upside down within her--that was how much she hated the innocent child for her beauty. These envious feelings grew like weeds in the heart of the Queen until she had no peace by day or by night. At last she could bear it no longer. She sent for a royal huntsman and told him to take the child into the woods and do away with her. \"And bring me a token,\" she added, \"so that I may be sure you've obeyed me.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2289, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b331b51-28e9-4109-bc38-5588583017c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b331b51-28e9-4109-bc38-5588583017c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/var/folders/hl/96z92_2n0ln6nc1ssp8d7h040000gn/T/tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_name": "tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 22717, "creation_date": "2024-09-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f69fca8d-9fb8-488b-9f37-72cf185de05b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/var/folders/hl/96z92_2n0ln6nc1ssp8d7h040000gn/T/tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_name": "tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 22717, "creation_date": "2024-09-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-18"}, "hash": "6b910b01bd5c2c14e941201a87077a8723b5db1b32de2659ccab29cb0adf9957", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So the huntsman called Snow White and led her into the woods but before he could harm her, she burst into tears and said, \"Oh please, dear hunter, have mercy! If you will let me go, I'll gladly wander away, far away into the wildwood and I'll never come back again.\"\n\nThe huntsman was glad enough to help the sweet innocent girl, so he said, \"Well, run away then, poor child, and may the beasts of the wood have mercy on you.\" As a token he brought back the heart of a wild boar, and the wicked Queen thought it was Snow White's. She had it cooked and ate it, I am sorry to say, with salt and great relish.\n\n*              *             *              *              *\n\nLittle Snow White wandered off into the depths of the wildwood. Above her were leaves and leaves and leaves, about her the trunks of hundreds of trees, and she didn't know what to do. She began to run, over jagged stones and through thorny thickets. She passed many wild animals on the way, but they did not hurt her. She ran all day, through woods and woods and over seven high high hills. At last, just at sunset, she came upon a tiny hut in a wooded glen. The door was open and there was no one at home, so she thought she would stay and rest herself a little.\n\nShe went in and looked around. Everything was very small inside, but as neat and charming as could be, and very very clean. At one end of the room stood a table decked in white, and on it were seven little plates, seven little knives and forks and spoons, and seven little goblets. In front of the table, each in its place, were seven little chairs; and at the far side of the room were seven beds, one beside the other, all made up with coverlets as pure and white as plum blossoms.\n\nSnow White was hungry and thirsty, so she took from each little plate a bit of vegetable and a bite of bread, and from each little goblet a sip of sweet wine. She had become very tired, too, from all her running, and felt like taking a nap. She tried one bed after another but found it hard to choose the one which really suited her.\n\nThe first little bed was too hard.\n\nThe second little bed was too soft.\n\nThe third little bed was too short.\n\nThe fourth little bed was too narrow.\n\nThe fifth little bed was too flat.\n\nThe sixth little bed was too fluffy.\n\nBut the seventh little bed was just right so she lay down in it and was soon fast asleep.\n\nAfter the sun had set behind the seventh hilltop and darkness had crept into the room, the masters of the little hut came home--they were seven little dwarfs who dug all day and hacked away at the hills, in search of gems and gold. They lit their seven little lights and saw right away that someone had been there, for things were not quite the same as they had left them in the morning.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2756, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b68a5e15-353d-4a75-b93e-97ec360684a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b68a5e15-353d-4a75-b93e-97ec360684a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/var/folders/hl/96z92_2n0ln6nc1ssp8d7h040000gn/T/tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_name": "tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 22717, "creation_date": "2024-09-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a402048-5d14-4b36-a144-c2f2c0036ee9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/var/folders/hl/96z92_2n0ln6nc1ssp8d7h040000gn/T/tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_name": "tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 22717, "creation_date": "2024-09-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-18"}, "hash": "941d05874af339ec85d9142d9ad6138a8c125cb6363f34da86ec5d263f65fdd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n\nSaid the first little dwarf, \"Who's been sitting in my chair?\"\n\nSaid the second little dwarf, \"Who's been eating from my plate?\"\n\nSaid the third, \"Who's been nibbling at my bread?\"\n\nSaid the fourth, \"Who's been tasting my vegetables?\"\n\nSaid the fifth, \"Who's been eating with my fork?\"\n\nAnd the sixth, \"Who's been cutting with my knife?\"\n\nAnd the seventh, \"Who's been drinking from my little goblet?\"\n\nNow the first little dwarf turned around, and saw a hollow in his bed and said, \"Someone's been sleeping in my bed.\"\n\nAnd the second little dwarf looked at his bed and said, \"Someone's been sleeping in mine too.

The seven little dwarfs circled round her in new admiration and awe, and said, \"What is your name, dear child?\"\n\n\"They call me Snow White,\" said she.\n\n\"And how did you find your way to our little home?\" asked the dwarfs.

One day the Queen, just to make sure, stood in front of her mirror and said:\n\n\"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,\n\nWho's the fairest one of all?\"\n\nAnd the mirror replied:\n\n\"Thou art very fair, Oh Queen,\n\nBut the fairest ever seen\n\nDwells within the wooded glen\n\nWith the seven little men.\"\n\nThe Queen turned green with fury when she heard this, for now she knew that the huntsman had deceived her, and that Snow White was still alive.\n\nDay and night she sat and pondered, and wondered what to do, for as long as she was not the fairest in the land, her jealous heart gave her no rest. At last she thought out a plan: she dyed her face and dressed herself to look like a peddler woman. She did it so well that no one would have known her, and then, with a basketful of strings and laces, she made her way over the seven hills to the home of the seven dwarfs. When she reached it she knocked at the little door and cried, \"Fine wares for sale! Fine wares for sale!\"\n\nSnow White peeped out of the window and said, \"Good day, my dear woman, what have you there in your basket?\"\n\n\"Good wares! Fine wares!\" said the woman. \"Strings, cords and laces, of all kinds and colors,\" and she held up a loop of gaily colored bodice laces.\n\nSnow White was entranced with the gaudy trifle and she thought to herself, \"The dwarfs were only afraid of the wicked Queen, but surely there can be no harm in letting this honest woman into the house.\" So she opened the door and bought the showy laces.\n\n\"Child,\" said the woman as she entered the little room, \"what a sight you are with that loose bodice! Come, let me fix you up with your new laces, so you'll look neat and trim for once.\"\n\nSnow White, who suspected nothing, stood up to have the new gay laces put into her bodice, but the woman worked quickly and laced her up so tightly that Snow White lost her breath and sank to the floor.\n\n\"Now!\" cried the Queen as she cast a last look at the motionless child, \"now you have been the fairest in the land!\"\n\nLuckily this happened just as the sun was sinking behind the", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2547, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "814f8e81-2743-429a-a6f4-0611cbad1871": {"__data__": {"id_": "814f8e81-2743-429a-a6f4-0611cbad1871", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/var/folders/hl/96z92_2n0ln6nc1ssp8d7h040000gn/T/tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_name": "tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 22717, "creation_date": "2024-09-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed1604b8-4820-44a0-8af7-650f8e89dc67", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/var/folders/hl/96z92_2n0ln6nc1ssp8d7h040000gn/T/tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_name": "tmpadp4zkum.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 22717, "creation_date": "2024-09-18", "last_modified_date": "2024-09-18"}, "hash": "50cd68a4a0b0228a1f89c6c3212e73bd8e0706409157ac4ee4d36672b78c3a33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "seventh hill, so it was not long before the dwarfs came trudging home from work.

And in that moment Snow White caught her breath again, opened her eyes, and all was well once more.\n\nWhen the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, \"That was no peddler woman, Snow White; that was the wicked Queen.

She fashioned a comb--a beautiful golden comb, but a poisonous one. Then, disguising herself as a different old woman, she crossed the seven hills to the home of the seven dwarfs.

The old woman stepped inside and said in honeyed tones, \"Why don't you try it on right now, my little rabbit? Look, I'll show you how it should be worn!\"\n\nPoor Snow White, innocent and trusting, stood there with sparkling eyes as the woman thrust the comb into her ebon hair.

But it was far from being as good as it looked, for it was so artfully made that half of it--the rosiest half--was full of poison.\n\nWhen the Queen had finished this apple she put it into a basket with some ordinary apples, and disguised herself as a peasant-wife. She crossed the seven hills to the home of the seven dwarfs and knocked at the door as before.\n\nSnow White peeped out of the window and said, \"I am not allowed to let anyone in, nor to buy anything either--the seven dwarfs have forbidden it.\"\n\n\"Suits me,\" said the peasant-wife, \"I can easily sell my fine apples elsewhere.

Gently they placed the crystal casket on their shoulders, slowly they walked away. But in spite of all their care, one of the servants made a false step and stumbled over a gnarly root.
